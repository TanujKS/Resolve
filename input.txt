SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

    Congress finds that the Constitution of the United States grants
explicit and broad authority to protect the right to vote, to regulate
elections for Federal office, and to defend the Nation's democratic
process. Congress enacts the ``For the People Act of 2021'' pursuant to
this broad authority, including but not limited to the following:
            (1) Congress finds that it has broad authority to regulate
        the time, place, and manner of congressional elections under
        the Elections Clause of the Constitution, article I, section 4,
        clause 1. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the ``substantive
        scope'' of the Elections Clause is ``broad''; that ``Times,
        Places, and Manner'' are ``comprehensive words which embrace
        authority to provide for a complete code for congressional
        elections''; and ``[t]he power of Congress over the Times,
        Places and Manner of congressional elections is paramount, and
        may be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it deems
        expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the
        regulations effected supersede those of the State which are
        inconsistent therewith''. Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of
        Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 8-9 (2013) (internal quotation marks and
        citations omitted). Indeed, ``Congress has plenary and
        paramount jurisdiction over the whole subject'' of
        congressional elections, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto)
        371, 388 (1879), and this power ``may be exercised as and when
        Congress sees fit'', and ``so far as it extends and conflicts
        with the regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes
        them''. Id. At 384. Among other things, Congress finds that the
        Elections Clause was intended to ``vindicate the people's right
        to equality of representation in the House''. Wesberry v.
        Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 16 (1964).
            (2) Congress also finds that it has both the authority and
        responsibility, as the legislative body for the United States,
        to fulfill the promise of article IV, section 4, of the
        Constitution, which states: ``The United States shall guarantee
        to every State in this Union a Republican Form of
        Government[.]''. Congress finds that its authority and
        responsibility to enforce the Guarantee Clause is particularly
        strong given that Federal courts have not enforced this clause
        because they understood that its enforcement is committed to
        Congress by the Constitution.
            (3)(A) Congress also finds that it has broad authority
        pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to legislate
        to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment,
        including its protections of the right to vote and the
        democratic process.
            (B) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the
        fundamental right to vote, which is ``of the most fundamental
        significance under our constitutional structure''. Ill. Bd. of
        Election v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979);
        see United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941) (``Obviously
        included within the right to choose, secured by the
        Constitution, is the right of qualified voters within a state
        to cast their ballots and have them counted . . .''). As the
        Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed, the right to vote is
        ``preservative of all rights'', Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S.
        356, 370 (1886). Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment also
        protects the right to vote, granting Congress additional
        authority to reduce a State's representation in Congress when
        the right to vote is denied.
            (C) As a result, Congress finds that it has the authority
        pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect
        the right to vote. Congress also finds that States and
        localities have eroded access to the right to vote through
        restrictions on the right to vote including excessively onerous
        voter identification requirements, burdensome voter
        registration procedures, voter purges, limited and unequal
        access to voting by mail, polling place closures, unequal
        distribution of election resources, and other impediments.
            (D) Congress also finds that ``the right of suffrage can be
        denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's
        vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free
        exercise of the franchise''. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533,
        555 (1964). Congress finds that the right of suffrage has been
        so diluted and debased by means of gerrymandering of districts.
        Congress finds that it has authority pursuant to section 5 of
        the Fourteenth Amendment to remedy this debasement.
            (4)(A) Congress also finds that it has authority to
        legislate to eliminate racial discrimination in voting and the
        democratic process pursuant to both section 5 of the Fourteenth
        Amendment, which grants equal protection of the laws, and
        section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which explicitly bars
        denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race,
        color, or previous condition of servitude.
            (B) Congress finds that racial discrimination in access to
        voting and the political process persists. Voting restrictions,
        redistricting, and other electoral practices and processes
        continue to disproportionately impact communities of color in
        the United States and do so as a result of both intentional
        racial discrimination, structural racism, and the ongoing
        structural socioeconomic effects of historical racial
        discrimination.
            (C) Recent elections and studies have shown that minority
        communities wait longer in lines to vote, are more likely to
        have their mail ballots rejected, continue to face intimidation
        at the polls, are more likely to be disenfranchised by voter
        purges, and are disproportionately burdened by voter
        identification and other voter restrictions. Research shows
        that communities of color are more likely to face nearly every
        barrier to voting than their white counterparts.
            (D) Congress finds that racial disparities in
        disenfranchisement due to past felony convictions is
        particularly stark. In 2020, according to the Sentencing
        Project, an estimated 5,200,000 Americans could not vote due to
        a felony conviction. One in 16 African Americans of voting age
        is disenfranchised, a rate 3.7 times greater than that of non-
        African Americans. In seven States-Alabama, Florida, Kentucky,
        Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming-more than one in
        seven African Americans is disenfranchised, twice the national
        average for African Americans. Congress finds that felony
        disenfranchisement was one of the tools of intentional racial
        discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress further finds
        that current racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement
        are linked to this history of voter suppression, structural
        racism in the criminal justice system, and ongoing effects of
        historical discrimination.
            (5)(A) Congress finds that it further has the power to
        protect the right to vote from denial or abridgment on account
        of sex, age, or ability to pay a poll tax or other tax pursuant
        to the Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments.
            (B) Congress finds that electoral practices including
        voting rights restoration conditions for people with
        convictions, voter identification requirements, and other
        restrictions to the franchise burden voters on account of their
        ability to pay.
            (C) Congress further finds that electoral practices
        including voting restrictions related to college campuses, age
        restrictions on mail voting, and similar practices burden the
        right to vote on account of age.

                PART 1--PROMOTING INTERNET REGISTRATION

SEC. 1001. REQUIRING AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET FOR VOTER REGISTRATION.

    (a) Requiring Availability of Internet for Registration.--The
National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 et seq.) is
amended by inserting after section 6 the following new section:

``SEC. 6A. INTERNET REGISTRATION.

    ``(a) Requiring Availability of Internet for Online Registration.--
Each State, acting through the chief State election official, shall
ensure that the following services are available to the public at any
time on the official public websites of the appropriate State and local
election officials in the State, in the same manner and subject to the
same terms and conditions as the services provided by voter
registration agencies under section 7(a):

        in which this section is in effect in the State).
    ``(c) Signature Requirements.--

        individual meets the requirements of this subsection as

SEC. 1011. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the ``Automatic Voter
Registration Act of 2021''.
    (b) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the right to vote is a fundamental right of
                citizens of the United States;
                    (B) it is the responsibility of the State and
                Federal Governments to ensure that every eligible
                citizen is registered to vote;
                    (C) existing voter registration systems can be
                inaccurate, costly, inaccessible and confusing, with
                damaging effects on voter participation in elections
                for Federal office and disproportionate impacts on
                young people, persons with disabilities, and racial and
                ethnic minorities; and
                    (D) voter registration systems must be updated with
                21st Century technologies and procedures to maintain
                their security.
            (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part--
                    (A) to establish that it is the responsibility of
                government at every level to ensure that all eligible
                citizens are registered to vote in elections for
                Federal office;
                    (B) to enable the State and Federal Governments to
                register all eligible citizens to vote with accurate,
                cost-efficient, and up-to-date procedures;
                    (C) to modernize voter registration and list
                maintenance procedures with electronic and internet
                capabilities; and
                    (D) to protect and enhance the integrity, accuracy,
                efficiency, and accessibility of the electoral process
                for all eligible citizens.

SEC. 1012. AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Requiring States To Establish and Operate Automatic
Registration System.--
            (1) In general.--The chief State election official of each
        State shall establish and operate a system of automatic
        registration for the registration of eligible individuals to
        vote for elections for Federal office in the State, in
        accordance with the provisions of this part.
            (2) Definition.--The term ``automatic registration'' means
        a system that registers an individual to vote in elections for
        Federal office in a State, if eligible, by electronically
        transferring the information necessary for registration from
        government agencies to election officials of the State so that,
        unless the individual affirmatively declines to be registered,
        the individual will be registered to vote in such elections.
    (b) Registration of Voters Based on New Agency Records.--The chief
State election official shall--
            (1) not later than 15 days after a contributing agency has
        transmitted information with respect to an individual pursuant
        to section 1013, ensure that the individual is registered to
        vote in elections for Federal office in the State if the
        individual is eligible to be registered to vote in such
        elections; and
            (2) not later than 120 days after a contributing agency has
        transmitted such information with respect to the individual,
        send written notice to the individual, in addition to other
        means of notice established by this part, of the individual's
        voter registration status.
    (c) One-Time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing
Agency Records.--The chief State election official shall--
            (1) identify all individuals whose information is
        transmitted by a contributing agency pursuant to section 1014
        and who are eligible to be, but are not currently, registered
        to vote in that State;
            (2) promptly send each such individual written notice, in
        addition to other means of notice established by this part,
        which shall not identify the contributing agency that
        transmitted the information but shall include--
                    (A) an explanation that voter registration is
                voluntary, but if the individual does not decline
                registration, the individual will be registered to
                vote;
                    (B) a statement offering the opportunity to decline
                voter registration through means consistent with the
                requirements of this part;
                    (C) in the case of a State in which affiliation or
                enrollment with a political party is required in order
                to participate in an election to select the party's
                candidate in an election for Federal office, a
                statement offering the individual the opportunity to
                affiliate or enroll with a political party or to
                decline to affiliate or enroll with a political party,
                through means consistent with the requirements of this
                part;
                    (D) the substantive qualifications of an elector in
                the State as listed in the mail voter registration
                application form for elections for Federal office
                prescribed pursuant to section 9 of the National Voter
                Registration Act of 1993, the consequences of false
                registration, and a statement that the individual
                should decline to register if the individual does not
                meet all those qualifications;
                    (E) instructions for correcting any erroneous
                information; and
                    (F) instructions for providing any additional
                information which is listed in the mail voter
                registration application form for elections for Federal
                office prescribed pursuant to section 9 of the National
                Voter Registration Act of 1993;
            (3) ensure that each such individual who is eligible to
        register to vote in elections for Federal office in the State
        is promptly registered to vote not later than 45 days after the
        official sends the individual the written notice under
        paragraph (2), unless, during the 30-day period which begins on
        the date the election official sends the individual such
        written notice, the individual declines registration in
        writing, through a communication made over the internet, or by
        an officially logged telephone communication; and
            (4) send written notice to each such individual, in
        addition to other means of notice established by this part, of
        the individual's voter registration status.
    (d) Treatment of Individuals Under 18 Years of Age.--A State may
not refuse to treat an individual as an eligible individual for
purposes of this part on the grounds that the individual is less than
18 years of age at the time a contributing agency receives information
with respect to the individual, so long as the individual is at least
16 years of age at such time. Nothing in the previous sentence may be
construed to require a State to permit an individual who is under 18
years of age at the time of an election for Federal office to vote in
the election.
    (e) Contributing Agency Defined.--In this part, the term
``contributing agency'' means, with respect to a State, an agency
listed in section 1013(e).

SEC. 1013. CONTRIBUTING AGENCY ASSISTANCE IN REGISTRATION.

    (a) In General.--In accordance with this part, each contributing
agency in a State shall assist the State's chief election official in
registering to vote all eligible individuals served by that agency.
    (b) Requirements for Contributing Agencies.--
            (1) Instructions on automatic registration.--With each
        application for service or assistance, and with each related
        recertification, renewal, or change of address, or, in the case
        of an institution of higher education, with each registration
        of a student for enrollment in a course of study, each
        contributing agency that (in the normal course of its
        operations) requests individuals to affirm United States
        citizenship (either directly or as part of the overall
        application for service or assistance) shall inform each such
        individual who is a citizen of the United States of the
        following:
                    (A) Unless that individual declines to register to
                vote, or is found ineligible to vote, the individual
                will be registered to vote or, if applicable, the
                individual's registration will be updated.
                    (B) The substantive qualifications of an elector in
                the State as listed in the mail voter registration
                application form for elections for Federal office
                prescribed pursuant to section 9 of the National Voter
                Registration Act of 1993, the consequences of false
                registration, and the individual should decline to
                register if the individual does not meet all those
                qualifications.
                    (C) In the case of a State in which affiliation or
                enrollment with a political party is required in order
                to participate in an election to select the party's
                candidate in an election for Federal office, the
                requirement that the individual must affiliate or
                enroll with a political party in order to participate
                in such an election.
                    (D) Voter registration is voluntary, and neither
                registering nor declining to register to vote will in
                any way affect the availability of services or
                benefits, nor be used for other purposes.
            (2) Opportunity to decline registration required.--Each
        contributing agency shall ensure that each application for
        service or assistance, and each related recertification,
        renewal, or change of address, or, in the case of an
        institution of higher education, each registration of a student
        for enrollment in a course of study, cannot be completed until
        the individual is given the opportunity to decline to be
        registered to vote.
            (3) Information transmittal.--Upon the expiration of the
        30-day period which begins on the date the contributing agency
        informs the individual of the information described in
        paragraph (1), each contributing agency shall electronically
        transmit to the appropriate State election official, in a
        format compatible with the statewide voter database maintained
        under section 303 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52
        U.S.C. 21083), the following information, unless during such
        30-day period the individual declined to be registered to vote:
                    (A) The individual's given name(s) and surname(s).
                    (B) The individual's date of birth.
                    (C) The individual's residential address.
                    (D) Information showing that the individual is a
                citizen of the United States.
                    (E) The date on which information pertaining to
                that individual was collected or last updated.
                    (F) If available, the individual's signature in
                electronic form.
                    (G) Information regarding the individual's
                affiliation or enrollment with a political party, if
                the individual provides such information.
                    (H) Any additional information listed in the mail
                voter registration application form for elections for
                Federal office prescribed pursuant to section 9 of the
                National Voter Registration Act of 1993, including any
                valid driver's license number or the last 4 digits of
                the individual's social security number, if the
                individual provided such information.
    (c) Alternate Procedure for Certain Contributing Agencies.--With
each application for service or assistance, and with each related
recertification, renewal, or change of address, any contributing agency
that in the normal course of its operations does not request
individuals applying for service or assistance to affirm United States
citizenship (either directly or as part of the overall application for
service or assistance) shall--
            (1) complete the requirements of section 7(a)(6) of the
        National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C.
        20506(a)(6));
            (2) ensure that each applicant's transaction with the
        agency cannot be completed until the applicant has indicated
        whether the applicant wishes to register to vote or declines to
        register to vote in elections for Federal office held in the
        State; and
            (3) for each individual who wishes to register to vote,
        transmit that individual's information in accordance with
        subsection (b)(3).
    (d) Required Availability of Automatic Registration Opportunity
With Each Application for Service or Assistance.--Each contributing
agency shall offer each individual, with each application for service
or assistance, and with each related recertification, renewal, or
change of address, or in the case of an institution of higher
education, with each registration of a student for enrollment in a
course of study, the opportunity to register to vote as prescribed by
this section without regard to whether the individual previously
declined a registration opportunity.

                enrolled at public secondary schools, including, where

                U.S.C. 9871(e)(2)).
                    (E) In the case of a State in which an individual
                disenfranchised by a criminal conviction may become
                eligible to vote upon completion of a criminal sentence

                   Subtitle E--Democracy Restoration

SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration Act of
2021''.

SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of
        citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates
        individuals with criminal convictions into free society,
        helping to enhance public safety.
            (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants
        Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an
        authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the Supreme
        Court.
            (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal
        protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the
        United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote
        may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any
        State on account of race, color, gender, or previous condition
        of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th
        Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact
        measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. The
        8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no excessive
        bail to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
        unusual punishments inflicted.
            (4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in State laws
        regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal
        elections:
                    (A) The lack of a uniform standard for voting in
                Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity and
                unequal participation in Federal elections based solely
                on where a person lives.
                    (B) Laws governing the restoration of voting rights
                after a criminal conviction vary throughout the
                country, and persons in some States can easily regain
                their voting rights while in other States persons
                effectively lose their right to vote permanently.
                    (C) State disenfranchisement laws
                disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities.
            (5) Two States (Maine and Vermont), the District of
        Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not
        disenfranchise individuals with criminal convictions at all,
        but 48 States have laws that deny convicted individuals the
        right to vote while they are in prison.
            (6) In some States disenfranchisement results from varying
        State laws that restrict voting while individuals are under the
        supervision of the criminal justice system or after they have
        completed a criminal sentence. In 30 States, convicted
        individuals may not vote while they are on parole and 27 States
        disenfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. In 11
        States, a conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement.
            (7) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals
        convicted of certain misdemeanors.
            (8) An estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the United States,
        or about 1 in 44 adults in the United States, currently cannot
        vote as a result of a felony conviction. Of the 5,200,000
        citizens barred from voting, only 24 percent are in prison. By
        contrast, 75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their
        communities while on probation or parole or after having
        completed their sentences. Approximately 2,200,000 citizens who
        have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due to
        restrictive State laws. In at least 6 States--Alabama, Florida,
        Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia--more than 5
        percent of the total voting-age population is disenfranchised.
            (9) In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-
        sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in
        practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and
        potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals
        must either obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an
        action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense
        and State. Individuals convicted of a Federal offense often
        have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.
            (10) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately
        impact racial and ethnic minorities. More than 6 percent of the
        African-American voting-age population, or 1,800,000 African
        Americans, are disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of every 16
        voting-age African Americans are rendered unable to vote
        because of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate more than
        3.7 times greater than non-African Americans. Over 6 percent of
        African-American adults are disenfranchised whereas only 1.7
        percent of non-African Americans are. In 7 States (Alabama, 16
        percent; Florida, 15 percent; Kentucky, 15 percent;
        Mississippi, 16 percent; Tennessee, 21 percent; Virginia, 16
        percent; and Wyoming, 36 percent), more than 1 in 7 African
        Americans are unable to vote because of prior convictions,
        twice the national average for African Americans.
            (11) Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised
        based upon their disproportionate representation in the
        criminal justice system. In recent years, Latinos have been
        imprisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent
        of the voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, are
        disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 states
        Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the general
        population. In 11 states 4 percent or more of Latino adults are
        disenfranchised due to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent;
        Arizona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent;
        Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 percent;
        Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11
        percent, Wyoming, 4 percent), twice the national average for
        Latinos.
            (12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a
        criminal offense and who are living and working in the
        community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their
        rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
            (13) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral
        participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting
        among family and community members of disenfranchised persons.
        Future electoral participation by the children of
        disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well.
            (14) The United States is the only Western democracy that
        permits the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals
        with felony convictions.

SEC. 1403. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.

    The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to

SEC. 1904. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VOTERS RESIDING IN INDIAN LANDS.

    (a) Accommodations Described.--
            (1) Designation of ballot pickup and collection
        locations.--Given the widespread lack of residential mail
        delivery in Indian Country, an Indian Tribe may designate
        buildings as ballot pickup and collection locations with
        respect to an election for Federal office at no cost to the
        Indian Tribe. An Indian Tribe may designate one building per
        precinct located within Indian lands. The applicable State or
        political subdivision shall collect ballots from those
        locations. The applicable State or political subdivision shall
        provide the Indian Tribe with accurate precinct maps for all
        precincts located within Indian lands 60 days before the
        election.
            (2) Provision of mail-in and absentee ballots.--The State
        or political subdivision shall provide mail-in and absentee
        ballots with respect to an election for Federal office to each
        individual who is registered to vote in the election who
        resides on Indian lands in the State or political subdivision
        involved without requiring a residential address or a mail-in
        or absentee ballot request.
            (3) Use of designated building as residential and mailing
        address.--The address of a designated building that is a ballot
        pickup and collection location with respect to an election for
        Federal office may serve as the residential address and mailing
        address for voters living on Indian lands if the tribally
        designated building is in the same precinct as that voter. If
        there is no tribally designated building within a voter's
        precinct, the voter may use another tribally designated
        building within the Indian lands where the voter is located.
        Voters using a tribally designated building outside of the
        voter's precinct may use the tribally designated building as a
        mailing address and may separately designate the voter's
        appropriate precinct through a description of the voter's
        address, as specified in section 9428.4(a)(2) of title 11, Code
        of Federal Regulations.
            (4) Language accessibility.--In the case of a State or
        political subdivision that is a covered State or political
        subdivision under section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965
        (52 U.S.C. 10503), that State or political subdivision shall
        provide absentee or mail-in voting materials with respect to an
        election for Federal office in the language of the applicable
        minority group as well as in the English language, bilingual
        election voting assistance, and written translations of all
        voting materials in the language of the applicable minority
        group, as required by section 203 of the Voting Rights Act of
        1965 (52 U.S.C. 10503), as amended by subsection (b).
            (5) Clarification.--Nothing in this section alters the
        ability of an individual voter residing on Indian lands to
        request a ballot in a manner available to all other voters in
        the State.

                computerized voter registration lists maintained under
                title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, so that
                individuals who contact the free telephone service
                established under paragraph (2) on the date of an
                election for Federal office may receive an immediate

        Justice and Federal courts for nearly a half a century to block
        discriminatory voting practices before their implementation in
        States and localities with the most troubling histories and
        ongoing records of racial discrimination.
            (3) There continues to be an alarming movement to erect
        barriers to make it more difficult for Americans to participate
        in our Nation's democratic process. The Nation has witnessed
        unprecedented efforts to turn back the clock and erect barriers
        to voting for communities of color which have faced historic
        and continuing discrimination, as well as disabled, young,
        elderly, and low-income Americans.
            (4) The Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby County v. Holder
        decision gutted decades-long Federal protections for
        communities of color that face historic and continuing
        discrimination, emboldening States and local jurisdictions to
        pass voter suppression laws and implement procedures, such as
        those requiring photo identification, limiting early voting
        hours, eliminating same-day registration, purging voters from
        the rolls, and reducing the number of polling places. Congress
        is committed to reversing the devastating impact of this
        decision.
            (5) Racial discrimination in voting is a clear and
        persistent problem. The actions of States and localities around
        the country post-Shelby County, including at least 10 findings
        by Federal courts of intentional discrimination, underscore the
        need for Congress to conduct investigatory and evidentiary
        hearings to determine the legislation necessary to restore the
        Voting Rights Act and combat continuing efforts in America that
        suppress the free exercise of the franchise in communities of
        color.
            (6) The 2018 midterm and 2020 general elections provide
        further evidence that systemic voter discrimination and
        intimidation continues to occur in communities of color across
        the country, making it clear that democracy reform cannot be
        achieved until Congress restores key provisions of the Voting
        Rights Act.
            (7) Congress must remain vigilant in protecting every
        eligible citizen's right to vote. Congress should respond by
        modernizing the electoral system to--
                    (A) improve access to the ballot;
                    (B) enhance the integrity and security of our
                voting systems;
                    (C) ensure greater accountability for the
                administration of elections;
                    (D) restore protections for voters against
                practices in States and localities plagued by the
                persistence of voter disenfranchisement; and
                    (E) ensure that Federal civil rights laws protect
                the rights of voters against discriminatory and
                deceptive practices.

     Subtitle B--Findings Relating to Native American Voting Rights

SEC. 2101. FINDINGS RELATING TO NATIVE AMERICAN VOTING RIGHTS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The right to vote for all Americans is sacred. Congress
        must fulfill the Federal Government's trust responsibility to
        protect and promote Native Americans' exercise of their
        fundamental right to vote, including equal access to voter
        registration voting mechanisms and locations, and the ability
        to serve as election officials.
            (2) The Native American Voting Rights Coalition's four-
        State survey of voter discrimination (2016) and nine field
        hearings in Indian Country (2017-2018) revealed obstacles that
        Native Americans must overcome, including a lack of accessible
        and proximate registration and polling sites, nontraditional
        addresses for residents on Indian reservations, inadequate
        language assistance for Tribal members, and voter
        identification laws that discriminate against Native Americans.
        The Department of Justice and courts have recognized that some
        jurisdictions have been unresponsive to reasonable requests
        from federally recognized Indian Tribes for more accessible and
        proximate voter registration sites and in-person voting
        locations.
            (3) The 2018 midterm and 2020 general elections provide
        further evidence that systemic voter discrimination and
        intimidation continues to occur in communities of color and
        Tribal lands across the country, making it clear that democracy
        reform cannot be achieved until Congress restores key
        provisions of the Voting Rights Act and passes additional
        protections.
            (4) Congress has broad, plenary authority to enact
        legislation to safeguard the voting rights of Native American
        voters.
            (5) Congress must conduct investigatory and evidentiary
        hearings to determine the necessary legislation to restore the
        Voting Rights Act and combat continuous efforts that suppress
        the voter franchise within Tribal lands, to include, but not to
        be limited to, the Native American Voting Rights Act (NAVRA)
        and the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA).

    Subtitle C--Findings Relating to District of Columbia Statehood

SEC. 2201. FINDINGS RELATING TO DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STATEHOOD.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 705,000 District of Columbia residents deserve
        voting representation in Congress and local self-government,
        which only statehood can provide.
            (2) The United States is the only democratic country that
        denies both voting representation in the national legislature
        and local self-government to the residents of its Nation's
        capital.
            (3) There are no constitutional, historical, fiscal, or
        economic reasons why the Americans who live in the District of
        Columbia should not be granted statehood.
            (4) Since the founding of the United States, the residents
        of the District of Columbia have always carried all of the
        obligations of citizenship, including serving in all of the
        Nation's wars and paying Federal taxes, but have been denied
        voting representation in Congress and freedom from
        congressional interference in purely local matters.
            (5) The District of Columbia pays more Federal taxes per
        capita than any State and more Federal taxes than 22 States.
            (6) The District of Columbia has a larger population than 2
        States (Wyoming and Vermont), and 6 States have a population
        under one million.
            (7) The District of Columbia has a larger budget than 12
        States.
            (8) The Constitution of the United States gives Congress
        the authority to admit new States (clause 1, section 3, article
        IV) and reduce the size of the seat of the Government of the
        United States (clause 17, section 8, article I). All 37 new
        States have been admitted by an Act of Congress, and Congress
        has previously reduced the size of the seat of the Government
        of the United States.
            (9) On June 26, 2020, by a vote of 232-180, the House of
        Representatives passed H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission
        Act, which would have admitted the State of Washington,
        Douglass Commonwealth from the residential portions of the
        District of Columbia and reduced the size of the seat of the
        Government of the United States to the United States Capitol,
        the White House, the United States Supreme Court, the National
        Mall, and the principal Federal monuments and buildings.

                 Subtitle D--Territorial Voting Rights

SEC. 2301. FINDINGS RELATING TO TERRITORIAL VOTING RIGHTS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The right to vote is one of the most powerful
        instruments residents of the territories of the United States
        have to ensure that their voices are heard.
            (2) These Americans have played an important part in the
        American democracy for more than 120 years.
            (3) Political participation and the right to vote are among
        the highest concerns of territorial residents in part because
        they were not always afforded these rights.
            (4) Voter participation in the territories consistently
        ranks higher than many communities on the mainland.
            (5) Territorial residents serve and die, on a per capita
        basis, at a higher rate in every United States war and conflict
        since WWI, as an expression of their commitment to American
        democratic principles and patriotism.

              CITIZEN RESIDENTS OF TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES.

        the United States;
            (2) impediments to full and equal voting rights for United
        States citizens who are residents of territories of the United
        States in Federal elections, including the election of the

            (3) impediments to full and equal voting representation in

        President of the United States;
            (5) recommended changes that, if adopted, would allow for

                    Subtitle E--Redistricting Reform

SEC. 2400. SHORT TITLE; FINDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Redistricting
Reform Act of 2021''.
    (b) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds that it
has the authority to establish the terms and conditions States must
follow in carrying out congressional redistricting after an
apportionment of Members of the House of Representatives because--
            (1) the authority granted to Congress under article I,
        section 4 of the Constitution of the United States gives
        Congress the power to enact laws governing the time, place, and
        manner of elections for Members of the House of
        Representatives; and
            (2) the authority granted to Congress under section 5 of
        the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution gives Congress the
        power to enact laws to enforce section 2 of such amendment,
        which requires Representatives to be apportioned among the
        several States according to their number.

          PART 1--REQUIREMENTS FOR CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING

SEC. 2401. REQUIRING CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING TO BE CONDUCTED
              THROUGH PLAN OF INDEPENDENT STATE COMMISSION.

    (a) Use of Plan Required.--Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, and except as provided in subsection (c) and subsection (d), any
congressional redistricting conducted by a State shall be conducted in
accordance with--
            (1) the redistricting plan developed and enacted into law
        by the independent redistricting commission established in the
        State, in accordance with part 2; or
            (2) if a plan developed by such commission is not enacted
        into law, the redistricting plan developed and enacted into law
        by a 3-judge court, in accordance with section 2421.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 22(c) of the Act entitled ``An
Act to provide for the fifteenth and subsequent decennial censuses and
to provide for an apportionment of Representatives in Congress'',
approved June 18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a(c)), is amended by striking ``in
the manner provided by the law thereof'' and inserting: ``in the manner
provided by the Redistricting Reform Act of 2021''.
    (c) Special Rule for Existing Commissions.--Subsection (a) does not
apply to any State in which, under law in effect continuously on and
after the date of the enactment of this Act, congressional
redistricting is carried out in accordance with a plan developed and
approved by an independent redistricting commission which is in
compliance with each of the following requirements:
            (1) Publicly available application process.--Membership on
        the commission is open to citizens of the State through a
        publicly available application process.
            (2) Disqualifications for government service and political
        appointment.--Individuals who, for a covered period of time as
        established by the State, hold or have held public office,
        individuals who are or have been candidates for elected public
        office, and individuals who serve or have served as an officer,
        employee, or paid consultant of a campaign committee of a
        candidate for public office are disqualified from serving on
        the commission.
            (3) Screening for conflicts.--Individuals who apply to
        serve on the commission are screened through a process that
        excludes persons with conflicts of interest from the pool of
        potential commissioners.
            (4) Multi-partisan composition.--Membership on the
        commission represents those who are affiliated with the two
        political parties whose candidates received the most votes in
        the most recent statewide election for Federal office held in
        the State, as well as those who are unaffiliated with any party
        or who are affiliated with political parties other than the two
        political parties whose candidates received the most votes in
        the most recent statewide election for Federal office held in
        the State.
            (5) Criteria for redistricting.--Members of the commission
        are required to meet certain criteria in the map drawing
        process, including minimizing the division of communities of
        interest and a ban on drawing maps to favor a political party.
            (6) Public input.--Public hearings are held and comments
        from the public are accepted before a final map is approved.
            (7) Broad-based support for approval of final plan.--The
        approval of the final redistricting plan requires a majority
        vote of the members of the commission, including the support of
        at least one member of each of the following:
                    (A) Members who are affiliated with the political
                party whose candidate received the most votes in the
                most recent statewide election for Federal office held
                in the State.
                    (B) Members who are affiliated with the political
                party whose candidate received the second most votes in
                the most recent statewide election for Federal office
                held in the State.
                    (C) Members who not affiliated with any political
                party or who are affiliated with political parties
                other than the political parties described in
                subparagraphs (A) and (B).
    (d) Treatment of State of Iowa.--Subsection (a) does not apply to
the State of Iowa, so long as congressional redistricting in such State
is carried out in accordance with a plan developed by the Iowa
Legislative Services Agency with the assistance of a Temporary
Redistricting Advisory Commission, under law which was in effect for
the most recent congressional redistricting carried out in the State
prior to the date of the enactment of this Act and which remains in
effect continuously on and after the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 2402. BAN ON MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING.

    A State that has been redistricted in accordance with this subtitle
and a State described in section 2401(c) or section 2401(d) may not be
redistricted again until after the next apportionment of
Representatives under section 22(a) of the Act entitled ``An Act to
provide for the fifteenth and subsequent decennial censuses and to
provide for an apportionment of Representatives in Congress'', approved
June 18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the State to
conduct such subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution
of the United States, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et
seq.), the Constitution of the State, or the terms or conditions of
this subtitle.

             PART 2--INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS

SEC. 2411. INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION.

    (a) Appointment of Members.--
            (1) In general.--The nonpartisan agency established or
        designated by a State under section 2414(a) shall establish an
        independent redistricting commission for the State, which shall
        consist of 15 members appointed by the agency as follows:
                    (A) Not later than October 1 of a year ending in
                the numeral zero, the agency shall, at a public meeting
                held not earlier than 15 days after notice of the
                meeting has been given to the public, first appoint 6
                members as follows:
                            (i) The agency shall appoint 2 members on a
                        random basis from the majority category of the
                        approved selection pool (as described in
                        section 2412(b)(1)(A)).
                            (ii) The agency shall appoint 2 members on
                        a random basis from the minority category of

                        section 2412(b)(1)(B)).

            (2) Factors taken into account in developing pool.--In
        selecting individuals for the selection pool under this
        subsection, the nonpartisan agency shall--
                    (A) ensure that the pool is representative of the
                demographic groups (including racial, ethnic, economic,
                and gender) and geographic regions of the State, and
                includes applicants who would allow racial, ethnic, and
                language minorities protected under the Voting Rights
                Act of 1965 a meaningful opportunity to participate in
                the development of the State's redistricting plan; and
                    (B) take into consideration the analytical skills

        agency in developing the selection pool under this subsection,
        the nonpartisan agency shall conduct interviews of applicants
        under oath. If an individual is included in a selection pool
        developed under this section, all of the interviews of the
        individual shall be transcribed and the transcriptions made
        available on the nonpartisan agency's website contemporaneously
        with release of the report under paragraph (6).
            (4) Determination of political party affiliation of
        individuals in selection pool.--For purposes of this section,
        an individual shall be considered to be affiliated with a
        political party only if the nonpartisan agency is able to
        verify (to the greatest extent possible) the information the
        individual provides in the application submitted under
        subsection (a)(1)(D), including by considering additional
        information provided by other persons with knowledge of the
        individual's history of political activity.
            (5) Encouraging residents to apply for inclusion in pool.--
        The nonpartisan agency shall take such steps as may be

        geographic regions and demographic groups are aware of the
        opportunity to serve on the independent redistricting
        commission, including publicizing the role of the panel and
        using newspapers, broadcast media, and online sources,
        including ethnic media, to encourage individuals to apply for
        inclusion in the selection pool developed under this
        subsection.

        the nonpartisan agency submits the selection pool to the Select
        Committee on Redistricting under paragraph (1), it shall
        publish and post on the agency's public website a report
        describing the process by which the pool was developed, and
        shall include in the report a description of how the
        individuals in the pool meet the eligibility criteria of
        subsection (a) and of how the pool reflects the factors the
        agency is required to take into consideration under paragraph
        (2).
            (7) Public comment on selection pool.--During the 14-day
        period which begins on the date the nonpartisan agency
        publishes the report under paragraph (6), the agency shall
        accept comments from the public on the individuals included in
        the selection pool. The agency shall post all such comments
        contemporaneously on the nonpartisan agency's website and shall
        transmit them to the Select Committee on Redistricting
        immediately upon the expiration of such period.

SEC. 2413. CRITERIA FOR REDISTRICTING PLAN; PUBLIC NOTICE AND INPUT.

    (a) Development of Redistricting Plan.--
            (1) Criteria.--Under the redistricting plan of a State,
        there shall be established single-member congressional
        districts using the following criteria as set forth in the
        following order of priority:
                    (A) Districts shall comply with the United States
                Constitution, including the requirement that they
                equalize total population.
                    (B) Districts shall comply with the Voting Rights
                Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) and all
                applicable Federal laws.
                    (C) Districts shall provide racial, ethnic, and
                language minorities with an equal opportunity to
                participate in the political process and to elect
                candidates of choice and shall not dilute or diminish
                their ability to elect candidates of choice whether
                alone or in coalition with others.
                    (D) Districts shall respect communities of
                interest, neighborhoods, and political subdivisions to
                the extent practicable and after compliance with the
                requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (C). A
                community of interest is defined as an area with
                recognized similarities of interests, including but not
                limited to ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social,
                cultural, geographic or historic identities. The term
                communities of interest may, in certain circumstances,
                include political subdivisions such as counties,
                municipalities, tribal lands and reservations, or
                school districts, but shall not include common
                relationships with political parties or political
                candidates.
            (2) No favoring or disfavoring of political parties.--
                    (A) Prohibition.--The redistricting plan developed
                by the independent redistricting commission shall not,
                when considered on a statewide basis, unduly favor or
                disfavor any political party.
                    (B) Determination of favoring or disfavoring.--For
                purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of
                whether a redistricting plan has the effect of unduly
                favoring or disfavoring a political party shall be
                based on the totality of circumstances, including, but
                not limited to, whether the plan results in durable
                partisan bias as determined by scientifically accepted
                measures of partisan fairness, or whether there are
                alternative plans that would have complied with the
                requirements of law and resulted in less durable levels
                of partisan bias. Notwithstanding the previous
                sentence, no redistricting plan shall be found to be in
                violation of subparagraph (A) because of application of
                the criteria set forth in subparagraphs (A), (B), or
                (C) of paragraph (1).
            (3) Factors prohibited from consideration.--In developing
        the redistricting plan for the State, the independent
        redistricting commission may not take into consideration any of
        the following factors, except to the extent necessary to comply
        with the criteria described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of
        paragraph (1), paragraph (2), and to enable the redistricting
        plan to be measured against the external metrics described in
        subsection (e):
                    (A) The residence of any Member of the House of
                Representatives or candidate.
                    (B) The political party affiliation or voting
                history of the population of a district.
    (b) Public Notice and Input.--
            (1) Use of open and transparent process.--The independent
        redistricting commission of a State shall hold each of its
        meetings in public, shall solicit and take into consideration
        comments from the public, including proposed maps, throughout
        the process of developing the redistricting plan for the State,
        and shall carry out its duties in an open and transparent
        manner which provides for the widest public dissemination
        reasonably possible of its proposed and final redistricting
        plans.
            (2) Website.--
                    (A) Features.--The commission shall maintain a

        as the case may be) to the development of a plan by the
        independent redistricting commission of the State under section
        2413(a).
            (2) Access to information and records of commission.--The
        Court shall have access to any information, data, software, or
        other records and material that was used (or that would have

        commission of the State in carrying out its duties under this
        subtitle.
            (3) Hearing; public participation.--In developing a
        redistricting plan for a State, the Court shall--
                    (A) hold one or more evidentiary hearings at which
                interested members of the public may appear and be
                heard and present testimony, including expert
                testimony, in accordance with the rules of the Court;

        by the public which are received during such period, the Court
        shall develop and publish the final redistricting plan for the
        State.
    (e) Use of Interim Plan.--In the event that the Court is not able
to develop and publish a final redistricting plan for the State with
sufficient time for an upcoming election to proceed, the Court may
develop and publish an interim redistricting plan which shall serve as
the redistricting plan for the State until the Court develops and
publishes a final plan in accordance with this section. Nothing in this
subsection may be construed to limit or otherwise affect the authority

SEC. 4001. FINDINGS RELATING TO ILLICIT MONEY UNDERMINING OUR
              DEMOCRACY.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt government officials
        frequently abuse anonymously held Limited Liability Companies
        (LLCs), also known as ``shell companies,'' to hide, move, and
        launder the dirty money derived from illicit activities such as
        trafficking, bribery, exploitation, and embezzlement. Ownership
        and control of the finances that run through shell companies
        are obscured to regulators and law enforcement because little
        information is required and collected when establishing these
        entities.
            (2) The public release of the ``Panama Papers'' in 2016 and
        the ``Paradise Papers'' in 2017 revealed that these shell
        companies often purchase and sell United States real estate.
        United States anti-money laundering laws do not apply to cash
        transactions involving real estate effectively concealing the
        beneficiaries and transactions from regulators and law
        enforcement.
            (3) Since the Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United
        v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), millions
        of dollars have flowed into super PACs through LLCs whose
        funders are anonymous or intentionally obscured. Criminal
        investigations have uncovered LLCs that were used to hide
        illegal campaign contributions from foreign criminal fugitives,
        to advance international influence-buying schemes, and to
        conceal contributions from donors who were already under
        investigation for bribery and racketeering. Voters have no way
        to know the true sources of the money being routed through
        these LLCs to influence elections, including whether any of the
        funds come from foreign or other illicit sources.
            (4) Congress should curb the use of anonymous shell
        companies for illicit purposes by requiring United States
        companies to disclose their beneficial owners, strengthening
        anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws.
            (5) Congress should examine the money laundering and
        terrorist financing risks in the real estate market, including
        the role of anonymous parties, and review legislation to
        address any vulnerabilities identified in this sector.
            (6) Congress should examine the methods by which corruption
        flourishes and the means to detect and deter the financial
        misconduct that fuels this driver of global instability.
        Congress should monitor government efforts to enforce United
        States anti-corruption laws and regulations.

    (a) Initial Notice.--

facially or as-applied, the constitutionality of any provision of this
Act or of chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or is
brought to with respect to any action of the Commission under chapter
95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the following rules
shall apply:
            ``(1) The action shall be filed in the United States
        District Court for the District of Columbia and an appeal from
        the decision of the district court may be taken to the Court of
        Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
            ``(2) In the case of an action relating to declaratory or

necessary, including orders to require interveners taking similar
positions to file joint papers or to be represented by a single
attorney at oral argument.
    ``(c) Challenge by Members of Congress.--Any Member of Congress may

  Subtitle C--Strengthening Oversight of Online Political Advertising

SEC. 4201. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Honest Ads Act''.

SEC. 4202. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this subtitle is to enhance the integrity of
American democracy and national security by improving disclosure
requirements for online political advertisements in order to uphold the
Supreme Court's well-established standard that the electorate bears the
right to be fully informed.

SEC. 4203. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of
        National Intelligence published a report titled ``Assessing
        Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections'',
        noting that ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an
        influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential
        election * * *''. Moscow's influence campaign followed a
        Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence
        operation--such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by
        Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party
        intermediaries, and paid social media users or ``trolls''.
            (2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington Post reported
        findings from 2 teams of independent researchers that concluded
        Russians ``exploited American-made technology platforms to
        attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment * * *
        as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing distrust in
        U.S. democracy and its leaders.''.
            (3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipulation of
        public opinion through social media conducted by the
        Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford
        Internet Institute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Russian
        bots to manipulate public discourse to a highly targeted
        audience. With a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers
        found that in the 2016 election's 3 decisive States, propaganda
        constituted 40 percent of the sampled election-related tweets
        that went to Pennsylvanians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and
        30 percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the
        figure reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Florida,
        40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35
        percent in Ohio.
            (4) On September 6, 2017, the Nation's largest social media
        platform disclosed that between June 2015 and May 2017, Russian
        entities purchased $100,000 in political advertisements,
        publishing roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated
        with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin organization.
        According to the company, the ads purchased focused ``on
        amplifying divisive social and political messages * * *''.
            (5) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act became law,
        establishing disclosure requirements for political
        advertisements distributed from a television or radio broadcast
        station or provider of cable or satellite television. In 2003,
        the Supreme Court upheld regulations on electioneering
        communications established under the Act, noting that such
        requirements ``provide the electorate with information and
        insure that the voters are fully informed about the person or
        group who is speaking.''.
            (6) According to a study from Borrell Associates, in 2016,
        $1,415,000,000 was spent on online advertising, more than
        quadruple the amount in 2012.
            (7) The reach of a few large internet platforms--larger
        than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider--has greatly
        facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation
        campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over
        210,000,000 Americans users--over 160,000,000 of them on a
        daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider
        has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite
        television provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the most-
        watched television broadcast in United States history had
        118,000,000 viewers.
            (8) The public nature of broadcast television, radio, and
        satellite ensures a level of publicity for any political
        advertisement. These communications are accessible to the
        press, fact-checkers, and political opponents; this creates
        strong disincentives for a candidate to disseminate materially
        false, inflammatory, or contradictory messages to the public.
        Social media platforms, in contrast, can target portions of the
        electorate with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on the
        basis of private information the platform has on individuals,
        enabling political advertisements that are contradictory,
        racially or socially inflammatory, or materially false.
            (9) According to comScore, 2 companies own 8 of the 10 most
        popular smart phone applications as of June 2017, including the
        most popular social media and email services--which deliver
        information and news to users without requiring proactivity by
        the user. Those same 2 companies accounted for 99 percent of
        revenue growth from digital advertising in 2016, including 77
        percent of gross spending. 79 percent of online Americans--
        representing 68 percent of all Americans--use the single
        largest social network, while 66 percent of these users are
        most likely to get their news from that site.
            (10) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Election
        Commission noted that only 18 percent of all Americans cited
        the internet as their leading source of news about the 2004
        Presidential election; by contrast, the Pew Research Center
        found that 65 percent of Americans identified an internet-based
        source as their leading source of information for the 2016
        election.
            (11) The Federal Election Commission, the independent
        Federal agency charged with protecting the integrity of the
        Federal campaign finance process by providing transparency and
        administering campaign finance laws, has failed to take action
        to address online political advertisements.
            (12) In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on
        Intelligence titled, ``Disinformation: A Primer in Russian
        Active Measures and Influence Campaigns'', multiple expert
        witnesses testified that while the disinformation tactics of
        foreign adversaries have not necessarily changed, social media
        services now provide ``platform[s] practically purpose-built
        for active measures[.]'' Similarly, as Gen. Keith B. Alexander
        (RET.), the former Director of the National Security Agency,
        testified, during the Cold War ``if the Soviet Union sought to
        manipulate information flow, it would have to do so principally
        through its own propaganda outlets or through active measures
        that would generate specific news: planting of leaflets,
        inciting of violence, creation of other false materials and
        narratives. But the news itself was hard to manipulate because
        it would have required actual control of the organs of media,
        which took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however,
        because the clear majority of the information on social media
        sites is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of
        information sources and other sites that can reinforce
        information, there is an increasing likelihood that the
        information available to average consumers may be inaccurate
        (whether intentionally or otherwise) and may be more easily
        manipulable than in prior eras.''.
            (13) Current regulations on political advertisements do not
        provide sufficient transparency to uphold the public's right to
        be fully informed about political advertisements made online.

SEC. 4204. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the dramatic increase in digital political
        advertisements, and the growing centrality of online platforms
        in the lives of Americans, requires the Congress and the
        Federal Election Commission to take meaningful action to ensure
        that laws and regulations provide the accountability and
        transparency that is fundamental to our democracy;
            (2) free and fair elections require both transparency and
        accountability which give the public a right to know the true
        sources of funding for political advertisements in order to
        make informed political choices and hold elected officials
        accountable; and
            (3) transparency of funding for political advertisements is
        essential to enforce other campaign finance laws, including the
        prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals.

        facility, mailing, or any other type of general public
        political advertising'' and inserting ``financing any public

       Subtitle A--Findings Relating to Citizens United Decision

SEC. 5001. FINDINGS RELATING TO CITIZENS UNITED DECISION.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The American Republic was founded on the principle that
        all people are created equal, with rights and responsibilities
        as citizens to vote, be represented, speak, debate, and
        participate in self-government on equal terms regardless of
        wealth. To secure these rights and responsibilities, our
        Constitution not only protects the equal rights of all
        Americans but also provides checks and balances to prevent
        corruption and prevent concentrated power and wealth from
        undermining effective self-government.
            (2) The Founders designed the First Amendment to help
        prevent tyranny by ensuring that the people have the tools they
        need to ensure self-government and to keep their elected
        leaders responsive to the public. The Amendment thus guarantees
        the right of everyone to speak, to petition the government for
        redress, to assemble together, and for a free press. If only
        the wealthiest individuals can participate meaningfully in our
        democracy, then these First Amendment principles become an
        illusion.
            (3) Campaign finance laws promote these First Amendment
        interests. They increase robust debate from diverse voices,
        enhance the responsiveness of elected officeholders, and help
        prevent corruption. They do not censor anyone's speech but
        simply ensure that no one's speech is drowned out. The Supreme
        Court has failed to recognize that these laws are essential,
        proactive rules that help guarantee true democratic self-
        government.
            (4) The Supreme Court's decisions in Citizens United v.
        Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) and McCutcheon
        v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 (2014), as well as other court decisions,
        erroneously invalidated even-handed rules about the spending of
        money in local, State, and Federal elections. These rules do
        not prevent anyone from speaking their mind, much less pick
        winners and losers of political debates. Although the Court has
        upheld other content-neutral laws like these, it has failed to
        apply to same logic to campaign finance laws. These flawed
        decisions have empowered large corporations, extremely wealthy
        individuals, and special interests to dominate election
        spending, corrupt our politics, and degrade our democracy
        through tidal waves of unlimited and anonymous spending. These
        decisions also stand in contrast to a long history of efforts
        by Congress and the States to regulate money in politics to
        protect democracy, and they illustrate a troubling deregulatory
        trend in campaign finance-related court decisions.
        Additionally, an unknown amount of foreign money continues to
        be spent in our political system as subsidiaries of foreign-
        based corporations and hostile foreign actors sometimes
        connected to nation-states work to influence our elections.
            (5) The Supreme Court's misinterpretation of the
        Constitution to empower monied interests at the expense of the
        American people in elections has seriously eroded over 100
        years of congressional action to promote fairness and protect
        elections from the toxic influence of money.
            (6) In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act in response to
        the concentration of corporate power in the post-Civil War
        Gilded Age. The Act prohibited corporations from making
        contributions in connection with Federal elections, aiming
        ``not merely to prevent the subversion of the integrity of the
        electoral process [but] * * * to sustain the active, alert
        responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the
        wise conduct of government''.
            (7) By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure requirements
        and campaign expenditure limits, and dozens of States passed
        corrupt practices Acts to prohibit corporate spending in
        elections. States also enacted campaign spending limits, and
        some States limited the amount that people could contribute to
        campaigns.
            (8) In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited corporations
        and unions from making campaign contributions or other
        expenditures to influence elections. In 1962, a Presidential
        commission on election spending recommended spending limits and
        incentives to increase small contributions from more people.
            (9) The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as
        amended in 1974, required disclosure of contributions and
        expenditures, imposed contribution and expenditure limits for
        individuals and groups, set spending limits for campaigns,
        candidates, and groups, implemented a public funding system for
        Presidential campaigns, and created the Federal Election
        Commission to oversee and enforce the new rules.
            (10) In the wake of Citizens United and other damaging
        Federal court decisions, Americans have witnessed an explosion
        of outside spending in elections. Outside spending increased
        more than 700 percent between the 2008 and 2020 Presidential
        election years. Spending by outside groups nearly doubled again
        from 2016 to 2020 with super PACs, tax-exempt groups, and
        others spending more than $3,000,000,000. And as political
        entities adapt to a post-Citizens United, post-McCutcheon
        landscape, these trends are getting worse, as evidenced by the
        record-setting 2020 elections which cost more than
        $14,000,000,000 in total.
            (11) Since the landmark Citizens United decision, 21 States
        and more than 800 municipalities, including large cities like
        New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia, have gone on
        record supporting a constitutional amendment. Transcending
        political leanings and geographic location, voters in States
        and municipalities across the country that have placed
        amendment questions on the ballot have routinely supported
        these initiatives by considerably large margins.
            (12) The Court has tied the hands of Congress and the
        States, severely restricting them from setting reasonable
        limits on campaign spending. For example, the Court has held
        that only the Government's interest in preventing quid pro quo
        corruption, like bribery, or the appearance of such corruption,
        can justify limits on campaign contributions. More broadly, the
        Court has severely curtailed attempts to reduce the ability of
        the Nation's wealthiest and most powerful to skew our democracy
        in their favor by buying outsized influence in our elections.
        Because this distortion of the Constitution has prevented other
        critical regulation or reform of the way we finance elections
        in America, a constitutional amendment is needed to achieve a
        democracy for all the people.
            (13) The torrent of money flowing into our political system
        has a profound effect on the democratic process for everyday
        Americans, whose voices and policy preferences are increasingly
        being drowned out by those of wealthy special interests. The
        more campaign cash from wealthy special interests can flood our
        elections, the more policies that favor those interests are
        reflected in the national political agenda. When it comes to
        policy preferences, our Nation's wealthiest tend to have
        fundamentally different views than do average Americans when it
        comes to issues ranging from unemployment benefits to the
        minimum wage to health care coverage.
            (14) At the same time millions of Americans have signed
        petitions, marched, called their Members of Congress, written
        letters to the editor, and otherwise demonstrated their public
        support for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens
        United that will allow Congress to reign in the outsized
        influence of unchecked money in politics. Dozens of
        organizations, representing tens of millions of individuals,
        have come together in a shared strategy of supporting such an
        amendment.
            (15) In order to protect the integrity of democracy and the
        electoral process and to ensure political equality for all, the
        Constitution should be amended so that Congress and the States
        may regulate and set limits on the raising and spending of
        money to influence elections and may distinguish between
        natural persons and artificial entities, like corporations,
        that are created by law, including by prohibiting such
        artificial entities from spending money to influence elections.

2021''.

                 PART 1--MY VOICE VOUCHER PILOT PROGRAM

SEC. 5101. ESTABLISHMENT OF PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Federal Election Commission (hereafter in

        described in section 5102(c);
            (4) information and assurances that the State will carry
        out a public information campaign as described in section
        5102(d);
            (5) information and assurances that the State will submit
        reports as required under section 5103; and
            (6) such other information and assurances as the Commission
        may require.
    (c) Selection of Participating States.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the beginning
        of the program application period, the Commission shall select
        the 3 States which will operate voucher pilot programs under
        this part.
            (2) Criteria.--In selecting States for the operation of the
        voucher pilot programs under this part, the Commission shall
        apply such criteria and metrics as the Commission considers
        appropriate to determine the ability of a State to operate the
        program successfully, and shall attempt to select States in a
        variety of geographic regions and with a variety of political
        party preferences.
            (3) No supermajority required for selection.--The selection
        of States by the Commission under this subsection shall require
        the approval of only half of the Members of the Commission.
    (d) Duties of States During Program Preparation Period.--During the
program preparation period, each State selected to operate a voucher
pilot program under this part shall take such actions as may be
necessary to ensure that the State will be ready to operate the program
during the program operation period, and shall complete such actions
not later than 90 days before the beginning of the program operation
period.
    (e) Termination.--Each voucher pilot program under this part shall
terminate as of the first day after the program operation period.
    (f) Reimbursement of Costs.--
            (1) Reimbursement.--Upon receiving the report submitted by
        a State under section 5103(a) with respect to an election
        cycle, the Commission shall transmit a payment to the State in
        an amount equal to the reasonable costs incurred by the State
        in operating the voucher pilot program under this part during
        the cycle.
            (2) Source of funds.--Payments to States under the program
        shall be made using amounts in the Freedom From Influence Fund
        under section 541 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
        (as added by section 5111), hereafter referred to as the
        ``Fund''.
            (3) Mandatory reduction of payments in case of insufficient
        amounts in freedom from influence fund.--
                    (A) Advance audits by commission.--Not later than
                90 days before the first day of each program operation
                period, the Commission shall--
                            (i) audit the Fund to determine whether,
                        after first making payments to participating
                        candidates under title V of the Federal
                        Election Campaign Act of 1971 (as added by
                        section 5111), the amounts remaining in the
                        Fund will be sufficient to make payments to
                        States under this part in the amounts provided
                        under this subsection; and
                            (ii) submit a report to Congress describing
                        the results of the audit.
                    (B) Reductions in amount of payments.--
                            (i) Automatic reduction on pro rata
                        basis.--If, on the basis of the audit described
                        in subparagraph (A), the Commission determines
                        that the amount anticipated to be available in
                        the Fund with respect to an election cycle
                        involved is not, or may not be, sufficient to
                        make payments to States under this part in the
                        full amount provided under this subsection, the
                        Commission shall reduce each amount which would
                        otherwise be paid to a State under this
                        subsection by such pro rata amount as may be
                        necessary to ensure that the aggregate amount
                        of payments anticipated to be made with respect
                        to the cycle will not exceed the amount
                        anticipated to be available for such payments
                        in the Fund with respect to such cycle.
                            (ii) Restoration of reductions in case of
                        availability of sufficient funds during
                        election cycle.--If, after reducing the amounts
                        paid to States with respect to an election
                        cycle under clause (i), the Commission
                        determines that there are sufficient amounts in
                        the Fund to restore the amount by which such
                        payments were reduced (or any portion thereof),
                        to the extent that such amounts are available,
                        the Commission may make a payment on a pro rata
                        basis to each such State with respect to the
                        cycle in the amount by which such State's
                        payments were reduced under clause (i) (or any
                        portion thereof, as the case may be).
                            (iii) No use of amounts from other
                        sources.--In any case in which the Commission
                        determines that there are insufficient moneys
                        in the Fund to make payments to States under
                        this part, moneys shall not be made available
                        from any other source for the purpose of making
                        such payments.
            (4) Cap on amount of payment.--The aggregate amount of
        payments made to any State with respect to any program
        operation period may not exceed $10,000,000. If the State
        determines that the maximum payment amount under this paragraph
        with respect to the program operation period involved is not,
        or may not be, sufficient to cover the reasonable costs
        incurred by the State in operating the program under this part
        for such period, the State shall reduce the amount of the
        voucher provided to each qualified individual by such pro rata
        amount as may be necessary to ensure that the reasonable costs
        incurred by the State in operating the program will not exceed
        the amount paid to the State with respect to such period.

SEC. 5102. VOUCHER PROGRAM DESCRIBED.

    (a) General Elements of Program.--
            (1) Elements described.--The elements of a voucher pilot
        program operated by a State under this part are as follows:
                    (A) The State shall provide each qualified
                individual upon the individual's request with a voucher
                worth $25 to be known as a ``My Voice Voucher'' during
                the election cycle which will be assigned a routing
                number and which at the option of the individual will
                be provided in either paper or electronic form.
                    (B) Using the routing number assigned to the My
                Voice Voucher, the individual may submit the My Voice
                Voucher in either electronic or paper form to qualified
                candidates for election for the office of
                Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner
                to, the Congress and allocate such portion of the value
                of the My Voice Voucher in increments of $5 as the
                individual may select to any such candidate.
                    (C) If the candidate transmits the My Voice Voucher
                to the Commission, the Commission shall pay the
                candidate the portion of the value of the My Voice
                Voucher that the individual allocated to the candidate,
                which shall be considered a contribution by the
                individual to the candidate for purposes of the Federal
                Election Campaign Act of 1971.
            (2) Designation of qualified individuals.--For purposes of
        paragraph (1)(A), a ``qualified individual'' with respect to a
        State means an individual--
                    (A) who is a resident of the State;
                    (B) who will be of voting age as of the date of the
                election for the candidate to whom the individual
                submits a My Voice Voucher; and
                    (C) who is not prohibited under Federal law from
                making contributions to candidates for election for
                Federal office.
            (3) Treatment as contribution to candidate.--For purposes
        of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the submission of
        a My Voice Voucher to a candidate by an individual shall be
        treated as a contribution to the candidate by the individual in
        the amount of the portion of the value of the Voucher that the
        individual allocated to the candidate.
    (b) Fraud Prevention Mechanism.--In addition to the elements
described in subsection (a), a State operating a voucher pilot program
under this part shall permit an individual to revoke a My Voice Voucher
not later than 2 days after submitting the My Voice Voucher to a
candidate.
    (c) Oversight Commission.--In addition to the elements described in
subsection (a), a State operating a voucher pilot program under this
part shall establish a commission or designate an existing entity to
oversee and implement the program in the State, except that no such
commission or entity may be comprised of elected officials.
    (d) Public Information Campaign.--In addition to the elements
described in subsection (a), a State operating a voucher pilot program
under this part shall carry out a public information campaign to
disseminate awareness of the program among qualified individuals.

SEC. 5103. REPORTS.

    (a) Preliminary Report.--Not later than 6 months after the first
election cycle of the program operation period, a State which operates

Commission analyzing the operation and effectiveness of the program
during the cycle and including such other information as the Commission
may require.
    (b) Final Report.--Not later than 6 months after the end of the
program operation period, the State shall submit a final report to the

the amendments made by this subtitle shall apply with respect to the
Presidential election held in 2028 and each succeeding Presidential

 Subtitle D--Personal Use Services as Authorized Campaign Expenditures

SEC. 5301. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Help America
Run Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to entry before
        they can consider running for office to serve their
        communities.
            (2) Current law states that campaign funds cannot be spent
        on everyday expenses that would exist whether or not a
        candidate were running for office, like childcare and food.
        While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege
        the independently wealthy who want to run, because given the
        demands of running for office, candidates who must work to pay
        for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively
        being left out of the process, even if they have sufficient
        support to mount a viable campaign.
            (3) Thus current practice favors those prospective
        candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to
        make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans who
        have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare,
        a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a
        seat at the table. This governance by the few is antithetical
        to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when
        lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans,
        their policies reflect that.
            (4) These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that
        does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York Times
        reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives
        cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2015
        survey by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the
        median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013,
        or 18 times the wealth of the typical American household.
            (5) These circumstances have also contributed to a
        governing body that does not reflect the nation it serves. For
        instance, women are 51 percent of the American population. Yet
        even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred
        Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more
        than three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The
        Center for American Women And Politics found that one third of
        women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from
        running for office, often by political professionals. This type
        of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions on using
        campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that
        still fall disproportionately on American women, particularly
        disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why
        only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in
        Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in
        other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best
        positioned to create policy that reflects the lived experience
        of most Americans.
            (6) Working mothers, those caring for their elderly
        parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for
        health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the
        people of the United States. Their networks and net worth are
        simply not the best indicators of their strength as prospective
        public servants. In fact, helping ordinary Americans to run may
        create better policy for all Americans.
    (c) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to ensure that all
Americans who are otherwise qualified to serve this Nation are able to
run for office, regardless of their economic status. By expanding
permissible uses of campaign funds and providing modest assurance that
testing a run for office will not cost one's livelihood, the Help
America Run Act will facilitate the candidacy of representatives who
more accurately reflect the experiences, challenges, and ideals of
everyday Americans.

supervisory responsibilities, shall make a determination as to whether
or not there is reason to believe that a person has committed, or is
about to commit, a violation of this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and as to whether or not the

counsel's determination shall take effect, unless during such 30-day
period the Commission, by vote of a majority of the members of the

violation, which may include a field investigation or audit, in
accordance with the provisions of this section. The general counsel
shall provide notification to the Commission of any intent to issue a
subpoena or conduct any other form of discovery pursuant to the
investigation. Upon the expiration of the 15-day period which begins on
the date the general counsel provides such notification, the general
counsel may issue the subpoena or conduct the discovery, unless during
such 15-day period the Commission, by vote of a majority of the members
of the Commission who are serving at the time, prohibits the general

counsel's recommendation that the Commission find either that there is
probable cause or that there is not probable cause to believe that a
person has committed, or is about to commit, a violation of this Act or
chapter 95 or chapter 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and
shall include with the recommendation a brief stating the position of
the general counsel on the legal and factual issues of the case.

recommendation under subparagraph (A), the general counsel shall

reasons therefore, shall provide the respondent with an opportunity to
submit a brief within 30 days stating the position of the respondent on

recommendation to the Commission under subparagraph (A) (or, if the
respondent submits a brief under subparagraph (B), not later than 30
days after the general counsel submits the respondent's brief to the

                sentence, the person may provide the general counsel

disregard any claim or defense by the Commission of prosecutorial
discretion as a basis for dismissing the complaint.
    ``(B)(i) Any party who has filed a complaint with the Commission

after the filing of the complaint, to either dismiss the complaint or
to find reason to believe a violation has occurred or is about to
occur, may file a petition with the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia.
    ``(ii) In any proceeding under this subparagraph, the court shall
treat the failure to act on the complaint as a dismissal of the
complaint, and shall determine by de novo review whether the agency's
failure to act on the complaint is contrary to law.
    ``(C) In any proceeding under this paragraph the court may declare
that the dismissal of the complaint or the failure to act is contrary
to law, and may direct the Commission to conform with such declaration
within 30 days, failing which the complainant may bring, in the name of
such complainant, a civil action to remedy the violation involved in
the original complaint.''.
