The article further states that, by doing so, President Trump actively undermined public faith and confidence in the integrity of American elections, subverted the rule of law, and placed his personal interests above the national interest.</p> <p>The second article states that President Trump has endeavored to undermine foundations of U.S. democracy, indicating an intention to make himself an authoritarian ruler who is unaccountable to the U.S. people. The article specifies the following actions by President Trump:</p> <ul> <li>refusing to acknowledge, and opposing efforts to protect against, Russian interference in U.S. affairs;</li> <li>expressing willingness to accept foreign assistance to win reelection;</li> <li>refusing to accept the results of the election;</li> <li>undermining the ability of American citizens to exercise their rights as voters;</li> <li>falsely alleging widespread voting fraud while producing no evidence;</li> <li>inciting his supporters to believe falsely that the election had been stolen from him; and</li> <li>failing to take action to protect federal officers, personnel, property, and institutions on January 6, 2021, when the Capitol was besieged by his supporters.</li> </ul> <p>Both articles state that, by such conduct, President Trump warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold U.S. office.</p>"
