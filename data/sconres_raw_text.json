and\n\n    (2) shared the experience of fearing for their safety as thousands of \nrioters surrounded and occupied areas of the Capitol complex, including the \nRotunda, Statuary Hall, and the Senate Chamber;\n\nWhereas the staff of the Parliamentarian of the Senate acted quickly and \n        selflessly to preserve the electoral vote certifications from theft or \n        destruction by those attempting to prevent Congress from carrying out \n        the constitutional duty of Congress to receive the votes of the \n        Electoral College;\nWhereas members of the Capitol custodial staff and Restaurant Associates staff \n        have bravely shown up to work, and maintained the standard of excellence \n        set by such staff, during a dangerous pandemic, continuing to provide \n        essential services to the congressional community;\nWhereas the dedicated staff of the Architect of the Capitol, who care for and \n        maintain the Capitol, immediately began working to repair the parts of \n        the Capitol that were damaged and vandalized during this tragic event;\nWhereas the people of the United States have already taken notice of the \n        incredible and diligent work done by Capitol personnel to care for and \n        repair the building in the wake of the January 6 attack, including by \n        sending thank you notes to the Capitol custodial staff;\nWhereas journalists continued to report to the world what was happening even as \n        those journalists were threatened, chased, surrounded, subjected to \n        physical violence, forced to shelter in place for hours, and had their \n        equipment stolen and destroyed by rioters;\nWhereas several members of the media were physically assaulted during the attack \n        on the Capitol, including a photojournalist who, once the press \n        credentials of the photojournalist were noticed by attackers, was thrown \n        to the floor, causing the photojournalist to fear for her life; and\nWhereas, due to the work of journalists who persisted in covering and \n        documenting the events of the day despite the danger those journalists \n        faced, the whole story of January 6 will be known: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat the Senate--\n            (1) commends the service and professionalism of the \n        personnel of the United States Capitol who, under \n        extraordinarily difficult circumstances, ensured Congress was \n        able to continue to operate and fulfill the constitutional \n        obligations of Congress; and\n            (2) expresses appreciation for, and solidarity with, the \n        women and men of the news media reporting on the work of \n        Congress, even at risk to their own personal safety.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n"

Galloway, 134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), the Supreme \n        Court of the United States affirmed that ``people of many faiths may be \n        united in a community of tolerance and devotion'';\nWhereas the principle of religious freedom ``has guided our Nation forward'', as \n        expressed by the 44th President of the United States in a Presidential \n        proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 2011, and freedom of religion \n        ``is a universal human right to be protected here at home and across the \n        globe'', as expressed by that President of the United States on \n        Religious Freedom Day in 2013;\nWhereas ``[f]reedom of religion is a fundamental human right that must be upheld \n        by every nation and guaranteed by every government'', as expressed by \n        the 42nd President of the United States in a Presidential proclamation \n        on Religious Freedom Day in 1999;\nWhereas the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects--\n\n    (1) the right of individuals to freely express and act on the religious \nbeliefs of those individuals;

and\n\n    (2) in 1822 that the constitutional freedom of religion is ``the most \ninalienable and sacred of all human rights'';\n\nWhereas religious freedom ``has been integral to the preservation and \n        development of the United States'', and ``the free exercise of religion \n        goes hand in hand with the preservation of our other rights'', as \n        expressed by the 41st President of the United States in a Presidential \n        proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 1993; and\nWhereas we ``continue to proclaim the fundamental right of all peoples to \n        believe and worship according to their own conscience, to affirm their \n        beliefs openly and freely, and to practice their faith without fear or \n        intimidation'', as expressed by the 42nd President of the United States \n        in a Presidential proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 1998: Now, \n        therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat Congress--\n            (1) on Religious Freedom Day on January 16, 2021, honors \n        the 235th anniversary of the enactment of the Virginia Statute \n        for Religious Freedom;

Bill of Rights''; 58 Stat. 284, chapter 268), which left \nadministration of its programs to the States, thus enabling blatant \ndiscrimination against African-American veterans;\n\n    (4) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which allowed labor unions to \ndiscriminate based on race;\n\n    (5) subprime lending aimed purposefully at families of color;\n\n    (6) disenfranchisement of Native Americans, who, until 1924, were \ndenied citizenship on land Native Americans had occupied for millennia;\n\n    (7) Federal Indian Boarding School policy during the 19th and 20th \ncenturies, the purpose of which was to ``civilize'' Native children through \nmethods intended to eradicate Native cultures, traditions, and languages;\n\n    (8) land policies toward Indian Tribes, such as the allotment policy, \nwhich caused the loss of over 90,000,000 acres of Tribal lands, even though \ntwo-thirds of that acreage was guaranteed to Indian Tribes by treaties and \nother Federal laws, and similar unjustified land grabs from Indian Tribes \nthat occurred regionally throughout the late 1800s and into the termination \nera in the 1950s and 1960s;\n\n    (9) the involuntary removal of Mexicans and United States citizens of \nMexican descent through large-scale discriminatory deportation programs in \nthe 1930s and 1950s;\n\n    (10) the United States annexation of Puerto Rico, which made Puerto \nRicans citizens of the United States without affording them voting rights;\n\n    (11) racial discrimination against Latino Americans, which has forced \nLatino Americans to fight continuously for equal access to employment, \nhousing, health care, financial services, and education;\n\n    (12) the Act entitled ``An Act to execute certain treaty stipulations \nrelating to Chinese'', approved May 6, 1892 (commonly known as the \n``Chinese Exclusion Act''; 22 Stat. 58, chapter 126), which effectively \nhalted immigration from China and barred Chinese immigrants from becoming \ncitizens of the United States, and which was the first instance of \nxenophobic legislation signed into law specifically targeting a specific \ngroup of people based on ethnicity;\n\n    (13) the treatment of Japanese Americans, despite no evidence of \ndisloyalty, as suspect and traitorous in the very country they helped to \nbuild, leading most notably to the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans \nbeginning in 1942;\n\n    (14) the conspiracy to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii and annex the \nland of the Kingdom of Hawaii, without the consent of or compensation to \nthe Native Hawaiian people of Hawaii; and\n\n    (15) the United States history of colonialism in the Pacific, which has \nresulted in economic, health, and educational disparities among other \ninequities, for people in United States territories, as well as independent \nnations with which the United States has treaty obligations;\n\nWhereas those discriminatory government actions, among other government policies \n        that have had racially disparate impacts, have disproportionately barred \n        African Americans and other people of color from building wealth, thus \n        limiting potential capital and exacerbating the racial wealth gap;\nWhereas research has shown that the persistent racial wealth gap has had a \n        significant negative impact on other racial disparities, such as the \n        achievement gap, disparities in school dropout rates, income gaps, \n        disparities in home ownership rates, health outcome disparities, and \n        disparities in incarceration rates;\nWhereas United States civic leaders and foundations have spearheaded critical \n        efforts to advance racial healing, understanding, and transformation \n        within the United States, recognizing that it is in our collective \n        national interest to urgently address the unhealed, entrenched divisions \n        that will severely undermine our democracy if they are allowed to \n        continue to exist;\nWhereas many of the most far-reaching victories for racial healing in the United \n        States have been greatly enhanced by the involvement, support, and \n        dedication of individuals from any and all racial groups;\nWhereas at the same time, much of the progress toward racial healing and racial \n        equity in the United States has been limited or reversed by our failure \n        to address the root cause of racism, the belief in the myth of a \n        hierarchy of human value based on superficial physical characteristics \n        such as skin color and facial features;\nWhereas the United States institution of slavery, as well as other examples \n        enumerated in this resolution, represent intentional and blatant \n        violations of the most basic right of every individual in the United \n        States to a free and decent life;\nWhereas the consequences of oppression against people of color have cascaded for \n        centuries, across generations, beyond the era of active enslavement, \n        imperiling for descendants of slaves and other targets of oppression \n        what should have otherwise been the right of every individual in the \n        United States to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;\nWhereas more than 40 countries have reckoned with historical injustice and its \n        aftermath through forming Truth and Reconciliation Commissions to move \n        toward restorative justice and to return dignity to their citizens;\nWhereas for 3 decades there has been a growing movement inside and outside \n        Congress to have the Federal Government develop material remedies for \n        the institution of slavery, including through a Commission to Study and \n        Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans described in H.R. 40, \n        117th Congress, as introduced on January 4, 2021, and S. 40, 117th \n        Congress, as introduced on January 25, 2021;\nWhereas the formation of a United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, \n        and Transformation does not supplant the formation of a Commission to \n        Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans, but rather \n        complements that effort; and\nWhereas contemporary social science, medical science, and the rapidly expanding \n        use of artificial intelligence and social media reveal the costs and \n        potential threats to our democracy if we continue to allow unhealed, \n        entrenched divisions to be ignored and exploited: Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat Congress--\n            (1) affirms, on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the \n        first slave ship to the United States, that the Nation owes a \n        long-overdue debt of remembrance to not only those who lived \n        through the egregious injustices enumerated in this resolution, \n        but also to their descendants; and\n            (2) urges the establishment of a United States Commission \n        on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation to properly \n        acknowledge, memorialize, and be a catalyst for progress \n        toward--\n                    (A) jettisoning the belief in a hierarchy of human \n                value;\n                    (B) embracing our common humanity; and\n                    (C) permanently eliminating persistent racial \n                inequities.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n"

which was \n       referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n\n \nRecognizing that the climate crisis is disproportionately affecting the \n   health, economic opportunity, and fundamental rights of children, \nexpressing the sense of Congress that renewed leadership by the United \n  States is needed to address the climate crisis, and recognizing the \n  need of the United States to develop a national, comprehensive, and \nscience-based climate recovery plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions, \nprotect and enhance natural sequestration, and put the United States on \n             a path toward stabilizing the climate system.\n\nWhereas a stable climate system at the founding of the United States allowed \n        human life and human civilization to flourish;\nWhereas the United States was founded on the deeply rooted principle of securing \n        ``the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity'';\nWhereas the Constitution of the United States protects the fundamental rights to \n        life, liberty, property, and equal protection of the laws;\nWhereas a climate system capable of sustaining human life--\n\n    (1) is fundamental to a free and ordered society; and\n\n    (2) is preservative of fundamental rights, including the rights to \nlife, liberty, property, personal security, family autonomy, bodily \nintegrity, and the ability to learn, practice, and transmit cultural and \nreligious traditions;\n\nWhereas the Federal Government sets the energy policy of the United States, \n        which has resulted in a national energy system in which approximately 80 \n        percent of the energy in the United States comes from fossil fuels;\nWhereas the national fossil fuel-based energy system has led to carbon dioxide \n        emissions from the United States constituting more than \\1/4\\ of \n        cumulative global carbon dioxide emissions;\nWhereas the United States is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, \n        due in substantial part to the Federal Government--\n\n    (1) opening up Federal public land and water for fossil fuel \nextraction; and\n\n    (2) actively supporting fossil fuel energy;\n\nWhereas there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that--\n\n    (1) human-caused climate change is occurring; and\n\n    (2) the rate of global heating and ocean acidification as of April 2021 \nis a result of the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, \nprimarily carbon dioxide emissions, largely from the combustion of fossil \nfuels;\n\nWhereas atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of over 400 parts per million as of \n        April 2021 have caused a dangerous planetary energy imbalance, \n        equivalent to the quantity of energy of exploding more than 400,000 \n        atomic bombs of the kind dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, per day, 365 days \n        per year, across the planet;\nWhereas the latest climate science and real-world observations of that energy \n        imbalance demonstrate that the approximately 1 degree Celsius of warming \n        that has already occurred as a result of human-caused climate change is \n        already dangerous and negatively affecting all aspects of society and \n        the economy of the United States;\nWhereas the last time that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were \n        over 400 parts per million--\n\n    (1) the seas were 70 to 90 feet higher;\n\n    (2) Greenland had no ice; and\n\n    (3) coral reefs suffered a major extinction;\n\nWhereas similar conditions will result if the United States does not drastically \n        reduce carbon dioxide emissions and naturally sequester excess \n        concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the 21st century;\nWhereas climate change is a threat to national security, as climate change \n        contributes to and exacerbates global instability and conflict;\nWhereas the generation of today's children was born into a climate system made \n        hazardous to their health and well-being because of human-caused climate \n        change;\nWhereas children are uniquely vulnerable to human-caused climate change because \n        of their developing bodies, higher exposure to air, food, and water per \n        unit of body weight, unique behavior patterns, dependence on caregivers, \n        and longevity on the planet;\nWhereas human-caused climate change is a public health emergency that is \n        adversely impacting the physical and mental health of children through--\n\n    (1) extreme weather events;\n\n    (2) rising temperatures and increased heat exposure;\n\n    (3) decreased air quality;\n\n    (4) altered infectious disease patterns;\n\n    (5) food and water insecurity; and\n\n    (6) other effects;\n\nWhereas the best scientific information available projects a 15- to 30-foot rise \n        in sea level by the year 2100 if current trends continue, with ever \n        greater rises and acceleration in subsequent centuries, resulting in \n        increased erosion and the loss of land, causing the loss of communities, \n        homes, infrastructure, agriculture, and coastal ecosystems for children \n        affected, until such time as levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \n        are dramatically reduced and steps are taken to cool the upper portion \n        of the ocean;\nWhereas infant mortality increases 25 percent on extremely hot days, with the \n        first 7 days of life representing a period of critical vulnerability;\nWhereas heat illness is a leading cause of death and illness in high school \n        athletes, with nearly 10,000 episodes of heat illness occurring \n        annually;\nWhereas 8.4 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis, and the ragweed \n        pollen season in North America has grown 13 to 27 days longer since 1995 \n        due to higher temperatures and greater atmospheric carbon dioxide \n        levels;\nWhereas children are especially susceptible to air pollution given their \n        developing lungs, higher ventilation rate, and higher levels of physical \n        activity;\nWhereas children exposed to smoke from wildfires, which have increased in \n        frequency and severity due to rising temperatures and droughts, suffer \n        substantial--\n\n    (1) eye symptoms; and\n\n    (2) upper and lower respiratory symptoms that lead to increased rates \nof asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits;\n\nWhereas long-term exposure to fine particulate matter, including from sources of \n        air pollution and smoke from wildfires, is associated with higher COVID-\n        19 mortality rates;\nWhereas extreme weather events can negatively impact the mental health of \n        children due to--\n\n    (1) family loss or separation;\n\n    (2) school interruption;\n\n    (3) scarcities of food, water, and shelter; and\n\n    (4) public service outages;\n\nWhereas, without immediate steps to address human-caused climate change, the \n        health effects of climate change on children will--\n\n    (1) increase in severity and in terms of the number of children \nimpacted; and\n\n    (2) cost the United States billions of dollars per year by the end of \nthe 21st century;\n\nWhereas children will largely shoulder the costs of human-caused climate change;\nWhereas further increases in global temperature will saddle children with an \n        enormous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden, undermining their economic \n        security and the economic security of the United States;\nWhereas children are deserving of special consideration and protection with \n        respect to human-caused climate change;\nWhereas children on the frontlines of human-caused climate change across the \n        United States and globally have risen up and called upon government \n        leaders around the world to take concrete, science-based, and equitable \n        action--\n\n    (1) to address human-caused climate change; and\n\n    (2) to ensure environmental and climate justice for their generation \nand future generations, including children from vulnerable communities that \nhave borne the brunt of climate change;\n\nWhereas children within environmental justice communities, including communities \n        of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities, that have \n        contributed the least to emissions--\n\n    (1) have long suffered from systemic environmental racism and social \nand economic injustices;\n\n    (2) are disproportionately burdened by adverse health or environmental \neffects; and\n\n    (3) are subjected to disproportionate energy burdens;\n\nWhereas members and children from frontline and environmental justice \n        communities, who are more likely to reside in areas with greater \n        exposure to air pollution, are disproportionately impacted by the COVID-\n        19 pandemic;\nWhereas global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations must be reduced to less \n        than 350 parts per million by the end of the 21st century, with further \n        reductions thereafter, to restore the energy balance of the planet, \n        stabilize the climate system, and protect the ice sheets and oceans for \n        posterity;\nWhereas existing and future adverse public health and other impacts and costs to \n        children and the United States can be significantly mitigated if the \n        United States acts promptly to reduce emissions from fossil fuels in the \n        United States;\nWhereas numerous experts have concluded that there are multiple technically and \n        economically feasible pathways to place all sectors of the economy of \n        the United States on an emissions-reduction path consistent with \n        returning global atmospheric carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million by \n        2100;\nWhereas producing energy in the United States with non-carbon emitting sources \n        will result in energy costs within the range of recent experience, \n        ultimately saving consumers money and stabilizing the cost of energy, \n        while increasing the number of jobs in the energy sector; and\nWhereas multiple Federal departments and agencies can exercise authority \n        delegated by Congress to prevent and respond to climate change, \n        including--\n\n    (1) the Department of Energy;\n\n    (2) the Department of the Interior;\n\n    (3) the Department of Agriculture;\n\n    (4) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n\n    (5) the Department of Commerce; and\n\n    (6) the Department of State: Now, therefore, be it\n\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat it is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) renewed leadership by the United States is needed \n        immediately to address the human-caused climate crisis that is \n        disproportionately affecting the health, economic opportunity, \n        and fundamental rights of the children of the United States; \n        and\n            (2) there is an urgent human-caused climate crisis that--\n                    (A) has inspired children across the United States \n                to organize and demand immediate government action to \n                protect their fundamental rights from the perils of \n                climate change; and\n                    (B) demands a national, comprehensive, science-\n                based, and just climate recovery plan that--\n                            (i) is prepared by Federal departments and \n                        agencies pursuant to delegated authority over \n                        energy and climate policy; and\n                            (ii) upholds the fundamental rights of \n                        children and puts the United States on a \n                        trajectory consistent with reducing global \n                        atmospheric carbon dioxide to less than 350 \n                        parts per million by 2100.\n                                 &lt;all&gt;\n</pre></body></html>\n"

Committee on Health, Education, \n                          Labor, and Pensions\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n\n \n Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the disparity in wages \n                    paid to men and to Black women.\n\nWhereas August 3, 2021, is Black Women's Equal Pay Day, which marks the day that \n        symbolizes how long into 2021 Black women must work to make what White, \n        non-Hispanic men were paid in 2020;\nWhereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)) \n        prohibits discrimination in compensation for equal work on the basis of \n        sex;\nWhereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) \n        prohibits discrimination in compensation because of race, color, \n        religion, national origin, or sex;\nWhereas, despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) 5 \n        decades ago, which requires that men and women in the same workplace be \n        given equal pay for equal work, Census Bureau data show that Black women \n        working full time, year round, are paid 63 cents for every dollar paid \n        to White, non-Hispanic men;\nWhereas, if the current trends continue, on average, Black women will have to \n        wait 100 years to achieve equal pay;\nWhereas the median annual pay for a Black woman in the United States working \n        full time, year round, is $41,098, which means that, on average, Black \n        women lose nearly $964,400 in potential earnings to the wage gap over \n        the course of a 40-year career;\nWhereas lost wages mean Black women have less money to support themselves and \n        their families, save and invest for the future, and spend on goods and \n        services, causing businesses and the economy to suffer as a result;\nWhereas Black women's median earnings are less than men's at every level of \n        academic achievement;\nWhereas, in the United States, more than 80 percent of Black mothers are key \n        breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families, but Black mothers \n        working full time are paid only 52 percent as much as fathers;\nWhereas the lack of access to affordable, quality childcare, paid family and \n        medical leave, paid sick leave, and other family-friendly workplace \n        policies contributes to the wage gap by forcing many Black women to \n        choose between their paycheck or job and getting quality care for \n        themselves or their family members;\nWhereas, if the wage gap were eliminated, on average, a Black woman working full \n        time would have enough money for approximately 2.5 additional years of \n        tuition and fees for a 4-year public university, the full cost of \n        tuition and fees for a 2-year community college, more than 16 additional \n        months of premiums for employer-based health insurance, 153 weeks of \n        food for her family, 15 additional months of mortgage and utilities \n        payments, 22 more months of rent, nearly 20 additional years of birth \n        control, or enough money to pay off student loan debt in just over 1 \n        year;\nWhereas 25 to 85 percent of women have been sexually harassed at the workplace, \n        and research has found that only a small number of women who experience \n        harassment, about 1 in 10, formally report incidents for reasons \n        including lack of access to the complaints processes and fear of \n        retaliation;\nWhereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave their occupation or \n        industry;\nWhereas targets of harassment were 6.5 times as likely as nontargets to change \n        jobs or pass up opportunities for advancement, contributing to the \n        gender wage gap;\nWhereas Black women were the most likely of all racial and ethnic groups to have \n        filed a sexual harassment charge;\nWhereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage or less are women, \n        and there is an overrepresentation of women of color in low-wage and \n        tipped occupations;\nWhereas more than 62 percent of women working in the private sector reported \n        that they were either discouraged or prohibited from discussing wage and \n        salary information, which can hide pay discrimination and prevent \n        remedies;\nWhereas the pay disparity Black women face is part of a wider set of disparities \n        Black women face in home ownership, unemployment, poverty, access to \n        childcare, and the ability to accumulate wealth;\nWhereas the gender wage gap for Black women has only narrowed by 3 cents in the \n        last 3 decades;\nWhereas true pay equity requires a multifaceted strategy that addresses the \n        gendered and racial injustices that Black women face daily;\nWhereas the pandemic has disproportionately economically impacted Black women; \n        and\nWhereas many national organizations have designated August 3, 2021, as Black \n        Women's Equal Pay Day to represent the additional time that women must \n        work to compensate for the lower wages paid to Black women last year: \n        Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), \nThat Congress--\n            (1) recognizes the disparity in wages paid to Black women \n        and its impact on women, families, and the United States; and\n            (2) reaffirms its support for ensuring equal pay for equal \n        work and narrowing the gender wage gap.\n
