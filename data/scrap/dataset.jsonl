The bill imposes various requirements related to certification of foreign sellers, labeling of imported drugs, and supply chain security.

Currently, the Department of Energy (DOE) may designate any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers. The bill expands the list of considerations DOE may use to select and designate a corridor. Specifically, DOE may consider whether the designation would (1) enhance the ability of facilities that generate or transmit renewable energy, low-emission energy, or emission-free energy to connect to the electric grid; (2) promote electrification of other sectors, including the transportation sector; or (3) facilitate other public policies to decarbonize the grid. DOE may also consider whether the designation maximizes existing rights-of-way, avoids sensitive environmental areas and cultural heritage sites, and would lower the cost of electricity for consumers. The bill also revises the authority (i.e., backstop authority) of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a permit for interstate transmission projects in such corridors when states and local governments fail to do so, including by specifying the timing for when FERC may issue such permits.

A plan in critical and declining status may not suspend payment of plan benefits.
