The maternal mortality\nrate is 1,054 deaths per 100,000 live births, making it one of\nthe highest in the world.\n(5) South Sudan faces many difficulties with its lack of\ninfrastructure and lacks significant human development factors,\nwhich can further marginalize women.\n(6) Over 80 percent of women and girls in South Sudan are\nilliterate, and thus it is imperative to both secure and inform\nwomen's rights within the national development.\n(7) With the assistance of internal aid and the\nproliferation of local women's organizations, women's equality\ncan be integrated into South Sudan's nation-building efforts.\n(8) South Sudan has made gains in incorporating women into\nthe new regime with efforts such as inclusion in the\nlegislative assembly, thus additional support from the United\nStates serves to reinforce these ideals and implementations.\n(9) The women of South Sudan are taking the initiative to\nreach across the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's\nperspectives and experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts\nare necessary to ensure lasting peace.\n(10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas,\nparticularly on military borders, is essential if women and\ngirls are to exercise their human rights, work, attend school,\nand otherwise participate in and benefit from humanitarian and\ndevelopment programs sponsored by the United States.\nSEC. 3.

McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New\nYork in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international\nunion of wood workers, called for and led a convention of\ncarpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the\nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United\nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888.\n(2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected\nMcGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that\nposition for twenty years.\n(3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally\nminded union activists around the United States that a national\nlabor federation was not only necessary, but also possible.\n(4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation\nof Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized\nit into the American Federation of Labor.\n(5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of\nLabor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900.\n(6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the eight-hour\nday in 1890.\n(7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that one day in the year be\ndesignated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by\na number of States and then as the first Monday in September by\nan Act of Congress in 1894.\n(8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of\nCarpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons,\nCamden, and had installed a massive granite multistage\nheadstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at\n1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with P.J.\nMCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and FOUNDER\nOF U.B. OF C. & J. OF A.\n(9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political\nleaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's\ngravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in\ntribute to McGuire and his great work.\n(10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday\napproached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to\ninstall a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's\ngravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced\nby a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns.\n(11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952,\nincludes--\n(A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of\nCherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with\nhis left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow\nbent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning\ncoat;\n(B) an inscription carved on front of the base of\nsuch sculpture that reads PETER J. MCGUIRE\/JULY 6,\n1852\/FEBRUARY 18, 1906'';\n(C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six\nGreek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia\nmarble;\n(D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the\ncolonnade that reads IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE\nFOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and\n(E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade\nthat reads ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF\nCARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952\n(12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union\nmembers, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication\nceremony on August 9, 1952, which featured as speakers--\n(A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of\nLabor;\n(B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken;\n(C) General President Hutcheson of the United\nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners;\n(D) the president of the American Federation of\nLabor, William Green;\n(E) the secretary and treasurer of the American\nFederation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained\nnational significance himself; and\n(F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice\nTobin.\n(13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to\nAmerican labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight\nEisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which\nhe met with the family and descendants of McGuire.\n(14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of\nFame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since\nbeen renamed the Hall of Honor.\n(15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has\ndocumented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national\nsignificance and importance in the labor history of the United\nStates.\n(16) The landscape characteristics, physical features,\noverall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire\nMemorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree\nof overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting,\nmaterials, and workmanship.\n(17) The sculptural representations of labor and union\nthemes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor\nleader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire\nMemorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-\npreserved.\n(18) National political and labor leaders have made annual\npilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter\nJ. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every\nSeptember on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since\n1952.\n(19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the\nPeter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are\nthe only properties that retain both the necessary direct\nassociation with McGuire as a person of national stature and\nthe high level of integrity required for listing on the New\nJersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of\nHistoric Places.\n(20) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire\nGravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures\nand properties that have achieved significance within the past\n50 years under the following criteria consideration categories\nof the National Register of Historic Places--\n(A) category (c), a grave of a historical figure\nof outstanding importance as there is no appropriate\nsite or building associated with McGuire's productive\nlife''; and\n(B) category (f), a property primarily\ncommemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or\nsymbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional\nsignificance\n(21) In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic\nPreservation Office certified that the Peter J. McGuire\nMemorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are eligible for\nlisting on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and\nNational Register of Historic Places.\n(22) On August 22, 2018, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and\nPeter J. McGuire Gravesite were added to the New Jersey\nRegister of Historic Places and, subsequently, on January 17,\n2019, added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\nThis Act may be cited as the Retired Pay Restoration Act\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n(1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled\nmilitary retirees were required to fund their own veterans'\ndisability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned\nretired pay for each dollar received in veterans' disability\ncompensation.\n(2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation to\nprogressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the\nretired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of\nfinancial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.\n(3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for\nall disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to\neasing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and\nfor combat-disabled retirees.\n(4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost\nconstraints, Congress effectively has authorized full\nconcurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent\ndisability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat-\nrelated disability ratings, while phasing out the disability\noffset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with\nnoncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50\npercent to 90 percent.\n(5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress\nacknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new\nthresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing\nto disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new\nthresholds.\n(6) Congress is not content with the status quo.\n(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that military\nretired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United\nStates should not be reduced because a military retiree is also\neligible for veterans' disability compensation awarded for service-\nconnected disability.\nSEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND VETERANS'\nDISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL MILITARY\nRETIREES WITH COMPENSABLE SERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITIES.\n(a) Extension of Concurrent Receipt Authority to Retirees With\nService-Connected Disabilities Rated Less Than 50 Percent.--Section\n1414(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n(1) by striking Compensation'' in the subsection heading\nand all that follows through Subject'' and inserting\nCompensation.--Subject''; and\n(2) by striking paragraph (2).\n(b) Amendments To Reflect Conclusion of Phase-In of Concurrent\nReceipt of Retired Pay and Veterans' Disability Compensation.--Section\n1414 of title 10, United States Code, is further amended--\n(1) in subsection (a), as amended by subsection (a) of this\nsection, by striking the final sentence;\n(2) by striking subsection (c) and redesignating\nsubsections (d) and (e) as subsections (c) and (d),\nrespectively; and\n(3) in subsection (d), as so redesignated, by striking\nparagraphs (3) and (4).\n(c) Specification of Qualified Retirees for Concurrent Receipt\nPurposes.--Section 1414 of title 10, United States Code, is further\namended--\n(1) in subsection (a), as amended by subsections (a) and\n(b)--\n(A) by striking a member or'' and all that\nfollows through is entitled'' and inserting an\nindividual who is a qualified retiree for any month is\nentitled''; and\n(B) by inserting retired pay and veterans'\ndisability compensation'' after both'';\n(2) in subsection (b)--\n(A) by striking Special Rules'' in the subsection\nheading and all that follows through is subject to''\nand inserting Special Rules for Chapter 61 Disability\nRetirees.--In the case of a qualified retiree who is\nretired under chapter 61 of this title, the retired pay\nof the member is subject to''; and\n(B) by striking paragraph (2); and\n(3) in subsection (d), as redesignated and amended by\nsubsection (b), by adding at the end the following new\nparagraph:\n(3) Qualified retiree.--The term qualified retiree'\nmeans a member or former member of the uniformed services who,\nwith respect to any month--\n(A) is entitled to retired pay, other than in the\ncase of a member retired under chapter 61 of this title\nwith less than 20 years of service creditable under\nsection 1405 of this title and less than 20 years of\nservice computed under section 12732 of this title; and\n(B) is entitled to veterans' disability\ncompensation.\n(d) Clerical Amendments.--\n(1) Section heading.--The heading of section 1414 of title\n10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\nSec. 1414.

{"prompt":"\n\nTo require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit the use of lead\nammunition on United States Fish and Wildlife Service lands, and for\nother purposes.\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled,\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\nThis Act may be cited as the Lead Endangers Animals Daily Act of\n2021'' or the LEAD Act of 2021\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\nCongress finds the following:\n(1) In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service\nrequired the use of nontoxic ammunition for all waterfowl\nhunting.\n(2) Research has shown that the presence of lead in the\nenvironment poses a threat to human and wildlife health.\n(3) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that\nlead is toxic to both humans and animals, and can negatively\naffect nearly every organ and system in the human body,\nincluding the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and\nreproductive and nervous systems. Lead exposure interferes with\nthe development of the nervous system and is therefore\nparticularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent\nlearning and behavioral disorders.\n(4) Lead is a potent neurotoxin, for which no safe exposure\nlevel exists for humans. The use of lead has been outlawed in\nand removed from paint, gasoline, children's toys, and many\nother items to protect human health and wildlife.\n(5) Wildlife, including federally listed threatened and\nendangered species, is at risk of lead toxicosis through the\ningestion of lead ammunition, either directly by ingesting lead\nfrom spent ballistic materials while foraging, or indirectly by\nscavenging carcasses and viscera left by hunters. Lead may also\npollute soil and water around outdoor shooting ranges.\n(6) Lead ammunition also endangers human food supplies.\nDairy and beef cattle have developed lead poisoning after\nfeeding in areas where spent lead ammunition has accumulated.\nSpent lead ammunition can also contaminate crops, vegetation,\nand waterways.\n(7) Humans are at risk of lead toxicosis through the\nconsumption of game meat harvested with lead ammunition.\n(8) Alternatives to lead ammunition are readily available,\nand studies have shown that nonlead ammunition performs just as\nwell as lead-based ammunition.\n(9) In January 2017, the outgoing Director of the United\nStates Fish and Wildlife Service issued Director's Order 219.\nIn March 2017, the Principal Deputy Director of the United\nStates Fish and Wildlife Service repealed this Order.\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\nCongress finds as follows:\n(1) Fort Pillow was originally built by Confederate troops\nin 1861 and named after General Gideon J. Pillow of Maury\nCounty, Tennessee.\n(2) The battle of Fort Pillow was fought on April 12, 1864,\nat Fort Pillow in Henning, Tennessee, during the American Civil\nWar.\n(3) At Fort Pillow, Tennessee, Confederate forces never\ndefeated the Union Navy. Instead, they perpetrated a heinous\nmassacre after violating a flag of truce by advantageously\nrepositioning rebel troops and by looting government buildings\nand private storefronts surrounding the fort.\n(4) According to the 1864 Report Fort Pillow Massacre''\nfrom the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct\nof the War, The officers and men seem to vie with each other\nin the devilish work; men, women and even children, wherever\nfound, were deliberately shot down, beaten and hacked with\nsabers. . . .\n(5) The Union garrison consisted of 19 officers and 538\ntroops of whom 262 were United States Colored Troops\n(U.S.C.T.).\n(6) Per the report, Of the men, from three hundred to\nfour hundred are known to have been killed at Fort Pillow, of\nwhom at least three hundred were murdered in cold blood after\nthe fort was in possession of the rebels and our men had thrown\ndown their arms and ceased to offer resistance.\n(7) The massacre at Fort Pillow demonstrated to all\nU.S.C.T. that surrender was not an option.

{"prompt":"\n\nTo authorize additional monies to the Public Housing Capital Fund of\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, and for other\npurposes.\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled,\nSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\nThis Act may be cited as the Public Housing Emergency Response\nAct\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\nThe Congress finds the following:\n(1) Housing is a foundational determinant of health and has\nbeen recognized as such since the early days of public health.\n(2) Poor housing conditions contribute to a broad range of\ninfectious diseases, chronic diseases, injuries, childhood\ndevelopment complications, nutrition issues, and mental health\nchallenges.\n(3) The United States Housing Act of 1937 (Public Law 75-\n412) charges the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(HUD) with providing residents with a decent, safe, and\naffordable place to live, including those that live in public\nhousing.\n(4) While public housing is a federally created program\noverseen by HUD, the properties are owned and managed at the\nlocal level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities\nunder contract with the Federal Government.\n(5) Thus, the public housing program is governed in part by\nFederal rules and regulations and in part by policies enacted\nat the local level.\n(6) Passage of the United States Housing Act of 1937 sought\nto address the needs of low-income people through public\nhousing. At the time of passage of such Act, the Nation's\nhousing stock was of very poor quality. Public housing was a\nsignificant improvement for those who had access to it.\n(7) However, over the years the living conditions in public\nhousing began to deteriorate as the operational needs of the\nunits and costs necessary to remedy major capital deficiencies\nbegan to outpace the level of funding provided by the Federal\nGovernment and the residents' rent contributions.\n(8) By 1990, no significant investment in housing\naffordable to the lowest-income individuals had been made by\nthe Federal Government in more than 30 years.\n(9) In 1998, the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work\nResponsibility Act of 1998 (title V of Public Law 105-276)\nprohibited public housing authorities from using any Federal\ncapital funding or operating funding to develop net new\nhousing.\n(10) More than a decade after the enactment of the Quality\nHousing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, the number of\npublic housing units nationally began to steadily decline, as\nmore units were torn down than rebuilt.\n(11) With the exception of an infusion of funding from the\neconomic stimulus legislation in 2009--the American Recovery\nand Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)--Federal capital\nfunding has remained relatively level for more than a decade,\ndespite an increasing backlog in unmet capital needs.\n(12) Today, there are approximately 1.2 million units of\npublic housing across the country receiving Federal funding.\nThe Nation's largest public housing authority, the New York\nCity Public Housing Authority, houses approximately 362,000\nresidents in 302 developments across New York City.\n(13) The Public Housing Capital Fund of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development remains the primary source of\nfunding public housing authorities rely on to address necessary\ninfrastructure upgrades and repairs.\n(14) As of October 2019, the national public housing\ncapital repairs backlog was estimated to stand at more than $70\nbillion.\n(15) Federal disinvestment in public housing has forced\nmany residents to live in accelerating substandard living. For\nexample, the New York City Housing Authority has a capital\nrepair backlog currently estimated at more than $40 billion.\nNew York City Housing Authority residents suffer from a\nconsistent lack of hot water, insufficient heat during the\nwinter months, rodent and insect infestations, broken\nelevators, and widespread and recurring lead and mold problems.\n(16) Substandard housing conditions, such as poor\nventilation, pest infestations, and water leaks, are directly\nassociated with the development and exacerbation of respiratory\ndiseases like asthma.\n(17) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has\nmade clear that no level of lead poisoning is safe. Lead\npoisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and affects\nevery major bodily system. At high levels, lead poisoning can\ncause anemia, multi-organ damage, seizures, coma, and death in\nchildren. Even with the lowest levels of lead exposure,\nchildren experience physical, cognitive, and neurobehavioral\nimpairment as well as lower IQ levels, lower class standing in\nhigh school, greater absenteeism, lower vocabulary and\ngrammatical-reasoning scores, and poorer hand-eye coordination\nrelative to other children.\n(18) Exposure to cold indoor temperatures is associated\nwith increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n(19) Due to its aging infrastructure, the living conditions\nin public housing are causing severe health consequences for\npublic housing residents throughout the Nation, including\nasthma, respiratory illness, and elevated blood lead levels.\n(20) For example, one leading study found that children\nliving in public housing have higher odds of asthma than\nchildren living in all types of private housing, even after\nadjusting for individual risk factors such as minority\nethnicity and race, living in a low-income household, and\nliving in a low-income community.\n(21) The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new\nlevel of risk into our society.\n(22) Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse\nhealth outcomes and infectious disease spread. One leading\nstudy found that counties with a higher percentage of\nhouseholds with poor housing had a higher incidence of, and\nmortality associated with, COVID-19 and recommended targeted\nhealth policies to support individuals living in poor housing\nconditions in order to mitigate adverse outcomes associated\nwith COVID-19.\n(23) This is a fixable public health crisis. Federal\ndisinvestment in public housing has consequences and aging\ninfrastructure is, in many cases, the root cause of many of\nthese health issues for residents.\n(24) Therefore, it is necessary to reinvest in public\nhousing, provide the money needed to fulfill outstanding\ncapital needs, and to again ensure that all Americans have a\ndecent home and suitable living environment, as is HUD's\ncharge.\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\nThere is authorized to be appropriated for assistance from the\nPublic Housing Capital Fund under section 9(d) of the United States\nHousing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) $70,000,000,000, which amount\nshall remain available until expended and, notwithstanding subsections\n(c)(1) and (d)(2) of such section 9, shall be allocated to public\nhousing agencies based upon the extent of such agencies' capital need,\nas determined according to the agencies' most recent Physical Needs\nAssessment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This bill authorizes additional assistance from the Public Housing Capital Fund to public housing agencies based upon capital need as determined by the agencies' most recent Physical Needs Assessment."}

These actions are limiting the ability for unions\nto prepare for negotiations and perform their legally required\nemployee representational duties.\n(5) Section 7101(a) of title 5, United States Code, states,\nCongress finds that labor organizations and collective\nbargaining in the civil service are in the public interest.\nAttempting to eliminate the union by eliminating almost all its\nofficial time repudiates the statutory position that unions are\nin the public interest.\n(6) Through these orders, agencies are required to comply\nwith artificial bargaining schedules, which undermine good\nfaith negotiations and divert the decision making to an impasse\npanel, which has no union representation on it and does not\nrepresent both parties.\n(7) Collectively, the administration's actions have\nviolated Congressional intent, undermined the ability of unions\nto engage in collective bargaining, blocked successful\ndiversity and inclusion training programs, and threatened the\nrights and benefits of millions of Federal workers.\nSEC. 3.

This decline brought\ngreenhouse gas emissions to their lowest levels since 1992.\n(3) Nuclear energy accounts for nine of the ten highest-\ngenerating power plants in the United States, and produces one-\nthird the carbon dioxide emissions of current solar\ntechnologies.\n(4) According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in\nterms of carbon dioxide emissions, the United States has\nconducted the largest absolute decline among all countries\nsince 2000\n(5) President Obama unilaterally joined the Paris Agreement\nwithout involving Congress, without consulting outside\nstakeholders such as energy companies, and without conducting a\ncost-benefit analysis, including an analysis of how a United\nStates nationally determined contribution (NDC) would impact\ncompetitiveness with countries like the People's Republic of\nChina (PRC) that threaten United States national and economic\nsecurity.\n(6) A report prepared by NERA Economic Consulting in 2017\nfound that meeting the commitments President Obama made as part\nof the Paris Agreement could reduce the United States gross\ndomestic product by $250,000,000,000 and eliminate 2,700,000\njobs by 2025.\n(7) Despite being the world's second largest economy, the\nPRC was permitted to be classified as a developing country''\nfor purposes of the Paris Agreement and abused this\nclassification when making its NDC under the Paris Agreement.\n(8) The PRC is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse\ngases, and according to the NDC submitted by the Chinese\nCommunist Party, it will continue raising emissions until 2030.\n(9) On September 22, 2020, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping\nannounced his intention for China to become carbon neutral by\n2060, a full decade later than the 2050 target date committed\nto by other major economies.\n(10) According to the IEA, coal-fired power plants were the\nsingle largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2018. China has\ndedicated over $50,000,000,000 through the Belt and Road\nInitiative to developing coal projects across 150 countries in\nthe past seven years, signaling a lack of genuine intent to\ncombat climate change.\n(11) During Paris negotiations, then-Secretary of State\nJohn Kerry acknowledged that even if all the developed world,\nwhich in this context does not include China, cut carbon\ndioxide emissions to zero, it would not offset the emissions\ncoming from the rest of the globe.\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\nThis Act may be cited as the United States-Israel PTSD\nCollaborative Research Act\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\nCongress makes the following findings:\n(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that between\n11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi\nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) in a given year. In addition, that\nfigure amounts to about 12 percent of Gulf War veterans and up\nto 30 percent of Vietnam veterans.\n(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that among\nwomen veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost\n20 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n(3) In the United States, it is thought that 70 percent of\nAmericans have experienced at least one traumatic event in\ntheir lifetime, and approximately 20 percent of those persons\nhave struggled or continue to struggle with symptoms of PTSD.\n(4) Studies show that PTSD has links to homelessness and\nsubstance abuse in the United States. The Department of\nVeterans Affairs estimates that approximately 11 percent of the\nhomeless population are veterans and the Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration estimates that about 7\npercent of veterans have a substance abuse disorder.\n(5) Our ally Israel, under constant attack from terrorist\ngroups, experiences similar issues with Israeli veterans facing\nPTSD symptoms. Tel Aviv University's National Center for\nTraumatic Stress and Resilience found that 5 to 8 percent of\ncombat soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and during\nwartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 percent.\n(6) Current treatment options in the United States focus on\ncognitive therapy, exposure therapy, or eye movement\ndesensitization and reprocessing, but the United States must\ncontinue to look for more effective treatments. Several leading\nIsraeli hospitals, academic institutions, and nonprofits\ndedicate research and services to treating PTSD.\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\nThe Congress finds the following:\n(1) Nationally, only 85 percent of students graduate from\nhigh school with a regular high school diploma.\n(2) Every school year, 523,000 American high school\nstudents drop out without earning a high school diploma or an\nalternative credential.\n(3) Only about 67 percent of American students with\nlimited English proficiency graduated on time from high school.\n(4) Only about 79 percent of Black students, 81 percent\nof Hispanic students, and 74 percent of American Indian\/Alaska\nNative students graduate on time from high school with a\nregular diploma, compared to 89 percent of White students and\n92 percent of Asian\/Pacific Islander students.\n(5) Only about 67 percent of American students with\ndisabilities graduated on time from high school.\n(6) High school is the final transition into adulthood\nand the world of work as students begin defining their\nindependence and forging their own pathways. As our next\ngeneration of leaders, our youth, are deciding their futures,\nthey are faced with many challenges, including peer pressure\nand bullying, high-stakes testing, the challenges of college\nadmissions, the scholarship and financial aid application\nprocess, and entrance into an ever more competitive job market.\nStudents need guidance and skills to help them navigate these\ncomplex decisions, which have serious and life changing\nconsequences.\n(7) School counseling programs are essential for students\nto achieve optimal personal growth, acquire positive social\nskills and values, set appropriate career goals, and realize\nfull academic potential to become productive, contributing\nmembers of the world community.\n(8) Professional secondary school counselors are highly\nqualified educators with a mental health perspective who\nunderstand and respond to the challenges presented by today's\ndiverse student population.\n(9) The professional secondary school counselor holds a\nmaster's degree or higher in school counseling (or the\nsubstantial equivalent), and is certified or licensed by the\nState in which the counselor works.\n(10) Professional secondary school counselors are\nintegral to the total educational program. They provide\nproactive leadership that engages all stakeholders in the\ndelivery of programs and services to help the student achieve\nsuccess in school. Professional secondary school counselors\nalign and work with the school's mission to support the\nacademic achievement of all students as they prepare for the\never-changing world of the 21st century.\n(11) Professional secondary school counselors'\nopportunities to assist students are often hindered by\nextraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. Currently,\nthe average student-to-counselor ratio in America's public\nschools is 430 to 1. The American School Counselor Association,\nthe American Counseling Association, and the National\nAssociation for College Admissions Counseling all recommend a\nratio of one school counselor to 250 students and a lower ratio\nfor counselors working primarily with students at risk.\nSEC. 1442.
