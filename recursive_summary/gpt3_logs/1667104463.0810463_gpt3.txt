Summary:

==========

RESPONSE:

This bill establishes a training program to teach early and mid-career scientists employed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) how to carry out mineral assessments and associated activities. The program will last for two years, and students will be required to participate in training sessions at least once every five years. Additionally, the USGS will be authorized to conduct joint training sessions with other data science and land management agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and state geological surveys. Finally, the bill requires the USGS to submit an annual report to Congress detailing any involvement of the Chinese and Russian governments in developing foreign mining and processing industries.
