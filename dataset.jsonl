Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) As a Member of Congress from the Tenth Congressional District of Texas, as majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Vice President and President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson's accomplishments in the fields of civil rights, education, and economic opportunity rank among the greatest achievements of the past half century. (2) As President, Lyndon Johnson proposed, championed, led to passage, and signed into law on August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which swept away barriers impeding millions of Americans from meaningful participation in American political life. (3) On July 30, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Social Security Amendments Act of 1965, popularly known as Medicare, which has transformed the delivery of health care in the United States and which, along with Social Security, reduced the rate of poverty among the elderly from 28.5 percent in 1966 to 9.1 percent in 2012. (4) On July 2, 1964, President Johnson secured passage and signed into law the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in employment, education, and public accommodations based on race, color, religion, or national origin. (5) On November 8, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Higher Education Act, which provided need-based financial aid to students in the form of scholarships, work-study grants, and loans, and thus made higher education more accessible to populations of persons who were previously unable to attend college because of economic circumstances. (6) On October 3, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which transformed the Nation's immigration system by abolishing the racially based quota system that had defined American immigration policy for four decades and replaced it with a policy whose central purpose was family reunification, with a preference for immigrants with specific skill sets. (7) According to Robert A. Caro, the preeminent biographer of Lyndon Baines Johnson, with the single exception of Lincoln, President Johnson was the greatest champion of the poor and underprivileged in the history of the Republic and was the President ``who wrote mercy and justice into the statute books by which America was governed''.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 4, 2021 Ms. Jackson Lee introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require that activities carried out by the United States in South Sudan relating to governance, reconstruction and development, and refugee relief and assistance support the basic human rights of women and women's participation and leadership in these areas. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Despite the 2011 referendum for secession that established the independent state of South Sudan, South Sudanese women continue to experience brutal violation of their human rights. (2) Strong and continued United States support can ensure that the advances made by South Sudanese women since July 2011 when the Republic of South Sudan gained its independence will continue and grow, rather than recede. (3) The United States has made a substantial contribution to the emergency relief and humanitarian efforts for South Sudan. Completing the United States mission in South Sudan will also require significant and long-term investments in development and reconstruction assistance. (4) An inadequate healthcare system has resulted in high maternal and infant mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate is 1,054 deaths per 100,000 live births, making it one of the highest in the world. (5) South Sudan faces many difficulties with its lack of infrastructure and lacks significant human development factors, which can further marginalize women. (6) Over 80 percent of women and girls in South Sudan are illiterate, and thus it is imperative to both secure and inform women's rights within the national development. (7) With the assistance of internal aid and the proliferation of local women's organizations, women's equality can be integrated into South Sudan's nation-building efforts. (8) South Sudan has made gains in incorporating women into the new regime with efforts such as inclusion in the legislative assembly, thus additional support from the United States serves to reinforce these ideals and implementations. (9) The women of South Sudan are taking the initiative to reach across the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's perspectives and experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts are necessary to ensure lasting peace. (10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas, particularly on military borders, is essential if women and girls are to exercise their human rights, work, attend school, and otherwise participate in and benefit from humanitarian and development programs sponsored by the United States. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO UNITED STATES ACTIVITIES RELATING TO SOUTH SUDAN. (a) In General.--Activities described in subsections (b) through (e) that are carried out by the United States in South Sudan shall comply with the applicable requirements contained in such subsections. (b) Governance of South Sudan.--With respect to the governance of South Sudan, the applicable requirements are the following: (1) Include the perspectives and advice from South Sudanese women's organizations, networks, and leaders in United States policymaking related to the governance of South Sudan. (2) Promote the inclusion of a significant number of women in the National Legislature and future legislative bodies to ensure that women's full range of human rights are included and upheld in any constitution or legal structures of South Sudan. (3) Promote the continuation and strengthening of the rights of women as the South Sudan Government transitions to a long-term government structure, and encourage the appointment of women to high-level positions within South Sudanese Government. (c) Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development.--With respect to activities relating to post-conflict stability in South Sudan, the applicable requirements are the following: (1) Ensure that a significant portion of United States development, humanitarian, and relief assistance is channeled to local and United States-based South Sudanese organizations, particularly South Sudanese women's organizations. Provide technical assistance, training, and capacity-building for local organizations to ensure that United States-funded efforts will be both effective and sustainable. (2) Encourage United States organizations that receive funds authorized by this Act to partner with or create South Sudanese-led counterpart organizations and provide these organizations with significant financial resources, technical assistance, and capacity building. (3) Provide direct financial and programmatic assistance to the Ministry of Women's Affairs adequate to ensure that the Ministry is able to fulfill its mandate. (4) Promote multiyear women-centered economic development programs, including programs to assist widows, female heads of household, women in rural areas, and disabled women. (5) Increase women's access to or ownership of productive assets such as land, water, agricultural inputs, credit, and property. (6) Provide long-term financial assistance for primary, secondary, higher, nontraditional, and vocational education for South Sudanese girls, women, boys, and men. (7) Provide financial assistance to build the health infrastructure and to deliver high-quality comprehensive health care programs, including primary, maternal, child, reproductive, and mental health care.

(9) Provide assistance to rehabilitate children affected by the conflict, particularly child soldiers.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  January 4, 2021 Ms. Jackson Lee introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To provide for research and education with respect to triple-negative breast cancer, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country. (2) The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90 percent for White women and 78 percent for African-American women. (3) African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate. (4) Early detection for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers. (5) Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources. (6) It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple- negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher. (7) Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by Hispanic women. (8) Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer which affects women under the age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. (9) African-American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than White women. (10) Triple-negative breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than most other types of breast cancer. (11) Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. (12) Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer is the key to survival because the tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that target these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, early detection and education is vital. (13) Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on-- (A) the rates of prevalence and incidence of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American, Hispanic, and other minority women; (B) the costs associated with treating triple- negative breast cancer; and (C) the methods by which triple-negative breast cancer may be prevented or cured in these women. SEC. 3. RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER. (a) Research.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health (in this section referred to as the ``Director of NIH'') shall expand, intensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and support of research with respect to triple-negative breast cancer.

(b) Dissemination of Information.--The Secretary may disseminate information under subsection (a) directly or through arrangements with nonprofit organizations, consumer groups, institutions of higher education, Federal, State, or local agencies, or the media. (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2022 through 2024. SEC. 5. INFORMATION TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH RESPECT TO TRIPLE- NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER. (a) Dissemination of Information.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall develop and disseminate to health care providers information on triple-negative breast cancer for the purpose of ensuring that health care providers remain informed about current information on triple-negative breast cancer.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 4, 2021 Mr. Norcross introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To designate the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite located in Pennsauken, New Jersey, as a National Historic Landmark, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Peter J. McGuire Labor Day Landmark Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Peter J. McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New York in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international union of wood workers, called for and led a convention of carpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888. (2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected McGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that position for twenty years. (3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally minded union activists around the United States that a national labor federation was not only necessary, but also possible. (4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized it into the American Federation of Labor. (5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of Labor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900. (6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the eight-hour day in 1890. (7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ``one day in the year be designated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by a number of States and then as the first Monday in September by an Act of Congress in 1894. (8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, Camden, and had installed a massive granite multistage headstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at 1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with ``P.J. MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and ``FOUNDER OF U.B. OF C. & J. OF A.''. (9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political leaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in tribute to McGuire and his great work. (10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday approached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to install a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's gravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced by a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns. (11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952, includes-- (A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of Cherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with his left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow bent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning coat; (B) an inscription carved on front of the base of such sculpture that reads ``PETER J. MCGUIRE/JULY 6, 1852/FEBRUARY 18, 1906''; (C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six Greek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia marble; (D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the colonnade that reads ``IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE FOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and (E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade that reads ``ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF CARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952''. (12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union members, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication ceremony on August 9, 1952, which featured as speakers-- (A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of Labor; (B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken; (C) General President Hutcheson of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners; (D) the president of the American Federation of Labor, William Green; (E) the secretary and treasurer of the American Federation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained national significance himself; and (F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice Tobin. (13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to American labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight Eisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which he met with the family and descendants of McGuire. (14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of Fame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since been renamed the Hall of Honor. (15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has documented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national significance and importance in the labor history of the United States. (16) The landscape characteristics, physical features, overall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree of overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting, materials, and workmanship. (17) The sculptural representations of labor and union themes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor leader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well- preserved. (18) National political and labor leaders have made annual pilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since 1952. (19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are the only properties that retain both the necessary direct association with McGuire as a person of national stature and the high level of integrity required for listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places. (20) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years under the following criteria consideration categories of the National Register of Historic Places-- (A) category (c), ``a grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance as there is no appropriate site or building associated with McGuire's productive life''; and (B) category (f), ``a property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance''. (21) In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office certified that the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are eligible for listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places. (22) On August 22, 2018, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite were added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and, subsequently, on January 17, 2019, added to the National Register of Historic Places. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF PETER J.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  years of military service or combat-related special compensation. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 13, 2021 Mr. Bilirakis introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services, and in addition to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To amend title 10, United States Code, to permit additional retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired pay by reason of their years of military service or combat-related special compensation. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Retired Pay Restoration Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned retired pay for each dollar received in veterans' disability compensation. (2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees. (3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and for combat-disabled retirees. (4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat- related disability ratings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent. (5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new thresholds. (6) Congress is not content with the status quo. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that military retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United States should not be reduced because a military retiree is also eligible for veterans' disability compensation awarded for service- connected disability.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Katherine's Lung Cancer Early Detection and Survival Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Lung cancer is the number 1 killer of all cancers. (2) Lung cancer causes more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer combined. (3) The reason for the extremely low 5-year survival rate in lung cancer patients is the difficulty to find it at early stages (as patients have no symptoms at early stages). (4) For all stages of lung cancer, the overall 5-year survival rate is 19 percent, while such rate is 98 percent for prostate cancer and 90 percent for breast cancer (all stages). (5) Early detection of lung cancer through screening could dramatically increase survival rates for patients. (6) Current law mandates free screening for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer at much earlier ages than for lung cancer, regardless of preexisting conditions of the individual to be screened. (7) Free screening starts at age 40 for breast cancer but for lung cancer does not start until age 55, and then and only for those with a history of smoking thirty or more packs of cigarettes per year.

(2) Members of the United States Capitol Police force were quickly overrun, enabling insurrectionists to breach the Capitol at multiple points. (3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman confronted an angry group of insurrectionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol, according to video footage taken by Igor Bobic, a reporter with the Huffington Post. (4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the mob's advance towards the United States Senate Chamber and announced the location of the incursion. (5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, Officer Goodman noticed the entrance to the Senate Chamber was unguarded. (6) As the mob approached, Officer Goodman intentionally diverted attention away from the Senate entrance and led the mob to an alternate location and additional awaiting officers. (7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington Post reporter from inside the Senate Chamber noted ``Senate sealed'' with Senators, staff, and members of the press inside. (8) Officer Eugene Goodman's selfless and quick-thinking actions doubtlessly saved lives and bought security personnel precious time to secure and ultimately evacuate the Senate before the armed mob breached the Chamber. (9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack on the Capitol, Officer Goodman's heroism is recognized not only from Members of Congress and staff but also from the American people they represent.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (a) In General.--Congress finds that-- (1) there is a compelling need to establish national protection for inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System in order to protect the unique social and ecological values of those irreplaceable resources; (2) roadless areas protect healthy watersheds and the numerous benefits of healthy watersheds, which include-- (A) providing the setting for many forms of outdoor recreation; (B) ensuring a supply of clean water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses; (C) providing drinking water to tens of millions of citizens of the United States; and (D) helping maintain abundant and healthy fish and wildlife populations and habitats; (3) maintaining roadless areas in a relatively undisturbed condition-- (A) saves downstream communities millions of dollars in water filtration costs; and (B) is crucial to preserve the flow of affordable, clean water to a growing population; (4) the protection of roadless areas can maintain biological strongholds and refuges for many imperiled species by halting the ongoing fragmentation of the landscape into smaller and smaller parcels of land divided by road corridors; (5) roadless areas conserve native biodiversity by serving as a bulwark against the spread of nonnative invasive species; (6) roadless areas provide important backcountry fish and game habitat, creating opportunities for hunting and commercial and sport fishing; (7) roadless areas provide unparalleled opportunities for outdoor recreation, including hiking, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting, fishing, cross-country skiing, canoeing, mountain biking, and similar activities; (8) while roadless areas may have many wilderness-like attributes, unlike wilderness areas, the use of mechanized means of travel is allowed in many roadless areas; (9) roadless areas contain many sites sacred to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and other groups that use roadless areas for spiritual and religious practices and access, including customary and traditional uses and activities; (10) from the inception of Federal land management, the mission of the Forest Service has been to manage the National Forest System for multiple uses, including resource utilization, conservation, and other uses; (11) consistent with the multiple-use mission described in paragraph (10), this Act-- (A) ensures the continued protection of social and ecological values, while allowing for many multiple uses of inventoried roadless areas; and (B) does not impose any new limitations on-- (i) inventoried roadless areas; or (ii) the use of, or access to, National Forest System, State, or private land outside inventoried roadless areas; (12) enacting a law for the protection of inventoried roadless areas-- (A) provides additional reliability to areas with recreation-based economies that depend on public land without roads for jobs, revenue, and consumer spending; and (B) encourages forest managers to continue giving priority to conducting fuel reduction treatments in the areas in which the treatments will have the most impact; (13) wildfires are almost twice as likely to occur in roaded areas as in roadless areas, because roadless areas are generally located further away from communities and are harder to access; (14) the Forest Service has an enormous backlog of maintenance needs for the existing 371,581-mile road system of the Forest Service that will cost $3,200,000,000 to eliminate; and (15) continued protection of roadless areas will continue to allow for the development of hydropower projects.

A change at a stationary source is not considered to be a modification under the bill if it is designed to (1) reduce the amount of any air pollutant emitted; or (2) restore, maintain, or improve the reliability of operations at, or safety of, the source. However, such changes are not excepted if the EPA determines the increase in the maximum achievable hourly emission rate from such change would cause an adverse effect on human health or the environment.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 21, 2021 Mr. Lieu introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit the use of lead ammunition on United States Fish and Wildlife Service lands, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Lead Endangers Animals Daily Act of 2021'' or the ``LEAD Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service required the use of nontoxic ammunition for all waterfowl hunting. (2) Research has shown that the presence of lead in the environment poses a threat to human and wildlife health. (3) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that lead is toxic to both humans and animals, and can negatively affect nearly every organ and system in the human body, including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems. Lead exposure interferes with the development of the nervous system and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavioral disorders. (4) Lead is a potent neurotoxin, for which no safe exposure level exists for humans. The use of lead has been outlawed in and removed from paint, gasoline, children's toys, and many other items to protect human health and wildlife.

Congress finds the following: (1) ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' is a beloved hymn that is currently produced and distributed by approximately 40 religious publishing houses throughout the United States. (2) ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' is regularly sung at various religious services and choir performances at community and cultural events to commemorate the struggles that have accompanied our Nation's ``pursuit of a more perfect Union''. (3) James Weldon Johnson wrote the poem ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' in 1899 to celebrate the anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's birthday, and his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, set the poem to music. (4) ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' was first performed on February 12, 1900, by a choir of 500 school children from the Stanton School in the Johnsons' hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, where James Weldon Johnson served as the principal. (5) In 1905, Booker T. Washington's recognition of ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' helped to make it a very popular song in Black communities throughout the United States. (6) In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt named James Weldon Johnson to diplomatic positions in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and when he returned to the United States, he became affiliated with the NAACP. (7) In the 1920s, the NAACP chose ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' as its official song and it was dubbed the ``Black National anthem''. (8) In 1934, James Weldon Johnson, a graduate of Clark Atlanta University, became the first African-American professor at New York University, and later served in a similar capacity at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. (9) The lyrics of ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' inspired the 16 foot sculpture, ``The Harp'' created by the renowned artist Augusta Savage and commissioned by the 1939 New York World's Fair. (10) ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' is sung at gatherings of the Faith and Politics Institute, whose bipartisan programs and pilgrimages include participation by Members of Congress, and was co-chaired for many years by the late Congressmen, Democrat John Lewis and Republican Amo Houghton, both of whom transitioned in 2020.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  February 1, 2021 Mr. Rush introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To conduct a special resource study of Fort Pillow Historic State Park in Henning, Tennessee, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as ``Fort Pillow National Battlefield Park Study Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Fort Pillow was originally built by Confederate troops in 1861 and named after General Gideon J. Pillow of Maury County, Tennessee. (2) The battle of Fort Pillow was fought on April 12, 1864, at Fort Pillow in Henning, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. (3) At Fort Pillow, Tennessee, Confederate forces never defeated the Union Navy. Instead, they perpetrated a heinous massacre after violating a flag of truce by advantageously repositioning rebel troops and by looting government buildings and private storefronts surrounding the fort. (4) According to the 1864 Report ``Fort Pillow Massacre'' from the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, ``The officers and men seem to vie with each other in the devilish work; men, women and even children, wherever found, were deliberately shot down, beaten and hacked with sabers. . . .''. (5) The Union garrison consisted of 19 officers and 538 troops of whom 262 were United States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.). (6) Per the report, ``Of the men, from three hundred to four hundred are known to have been killed at Fort Pillow, of whom at least three hundred were murdered in cold blood after the fort was in possession of the rebels and our men had thrown down their arms and ceased to offer resistance.''. (7) The massacre at Fort Pillow demonstrated to all U.S.C.T. that surrender was not an option. The massacre at Fort Pillow became a rallying cry and motivation for the 209,147 U.S.C.T. (8) The 209,147 U.S.C.T. fundamentally contributed to the Union's defeat of the Confederacy. (9) The State of Tennessee allows the wrongful modification of the historical record by claiming it was a battle without a massacre of hundreds of surrendering Union troops and innocent civilians. (10) In 1971, Fort Pillow became a State park. (11) In 1973, Fort Pillow was added to the National Register of Historic Places. (12) The following year, in 1974, Fort Pillow was designated as a National Historic Landmark. (13) Fort Pillow Historic State Park consists of 1,642 acres. (14) The Park contains several attraction areas such as a Civil War museum, hiking trail, camping ground, and picnic area. (15) This site deserves to become a National Battlefield Park due to its profound effect on U.S.C.T. and all Union forces in their fight to preserve the United States of America. SEC. 3. FORT PILLOW SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY. The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a special resource study of Fort Pillow Historic State Park in Henning, Tennessee. Fort Pillow is a State park that features the American Civil War history and the Massacre at Fort Pillow. The Secretary shall-- (1) evaluate the site's national significance; and", "completion": " Fort Pillow National Battlefield Park Study Act This bill directs the Department of the Interior to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating&nbsp;the Fort Pillow Historic State Park in Henning, Tennessee, which was the site of the Battle of Fort Pillow during the Civil War, as a unit of the National Park System."}

Maloney of New York, Mr. Espaillat, Ms. Meng, Mr. Nadler, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Clarke of New York, Mr. Jeffries, Miss Rice of New York, and Mr. Suozzi) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Financial Services _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To authorize additional monies to the Public Housing Capital Fund of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Public Housing Emergency Response Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Housing is a foundational determinant of health and has been recognized as such since the early days of public health. (2) Poor housing conditions contribute to a broad range of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, injuries, childhood development complications, nutrition issues, and mental health challenges. (3) The United States Housing Act of 1937 (Public Law 75- 412) charges the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with providing residents with a decent, safe, and affordable place to live, including those that live in public housing. (4) While public housing is a federally created program overseen by HUD, the properties are owned and managed at the local level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities under contract with the Federal Government. (5) Thus, the public housing program is governed in part by Federal rules and regulations and in part by policies enacted at the local level. (6) Passage of the United States Housing Act of 1937 sought to address the needs of low-income people through public housing. At the time of passage of such Act, the Nation's housing stock was of very poor quality. Public housing was a significant improvement for those who had access to it. (7) However, over the years the living conditions in public housing began to deteriorate as the operational needs of the units and costs necessary to remedy major capital deficiencies began to outpace the level of funding provided by the Federal Government and the residents' rent contributions. (8) By 1990, no significant investment in housing affordable to the lowest-income individuals had been made by the Federal Government in more than 30 years. (9) In 1998, the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (title V of Public Law 105-276) prohibited public housing authorities from using any Federal capital funding or operating funding to develop net new housing. (10) More than a decade after the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, the number of public housing units nationally began to steadily decline, as more units were torn down than rebuilt. (11) With the exception of an infusion of funding from the economic stimulus legislation in 2009--the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)--Federal capital funding has remained relatively level for more than a decade, despite an increasing backlog in unmet capital needs. (12) Today, there are approximately 1.2 million units of public housing across the country receiving Federal funding. The Nation's largest public housing authority, the New York City Public Housing Authority, houses approximately 362,000 residents in 302 developments across New York City. (13) The Public Housing Capital Fund of the Department of Housing and Urban Development remains the primary source of funding public housing authorities rely on to address necessary infrastructure upgrades and repairs. (14) As of October 2019, the national public housing capital repairs backlog was estimated to stand at more than $70 billion. (15) Federal disinvestment in public housing has forced many residents to live in accelerating substandard living. For example, the New York City Housing Authority has a capital repair backlog currently estimated at more than $40 billion. New York City Housing Authority residents suffer from a consistent lack of hot water, insufficient heat during the winter months, rodent and insect infestations, broken elevators, and widespread and recurring lead and mold problems. (16) Substandard housing conditions, such as poor ventilation, pest infestations, and water leaks, are directly associated with the development and exacerbation of respiratory diseases like asthma. (17) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made clear that no level of lead poisoning is safe. Lead poisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and affects every major bodily system. At high levels, lead poisoning can cause anemia, multi-organ damage, seizures, coma, and death in children. Even with the lowest levels of lead exposure, children experience physical, cognitive, and neurobehavioral impairment as well as lower IQ levels, lower class standing in high school, greater absenteeism, lower vocabulary and grammatical-reasoning scores, and poorer hand-eye coordination relative to other children. (18) Exposure to cold indoor temperatures is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. (19) Due to its aging infrastructure, the living conditions in public housing are causing severe health consequences for public housing residents throughout the Nation, including asthma, respiratory illness, and elevated blood lead levels. (20) For example, one leading study found that children living in public housing have higher odds of asthma than children living in all types of private housing, even after adjusting for individual risk factors such as minority ethnicity and race, living in a low-income household, and living in a low-income community. (21) The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new level of risk into our society. (22) Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious disease spread. One leading study found that counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had a higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19 and recommended targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions in order to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19. (23) This is a fixable public health crisis. Federal disinvestment in public housing has consequences and aging infrastructure is, in many cases, the root cause of many of these health issues for residents. (24) Therefore, it is necessary to reinvest in public housing, provide the money needed to fulfill outstanding capital needs, and to again ensure that all Americans have a decent home and suitable living environment, as is HUD's charge. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. There is authorized to be appropriated for assistance from the Public Housing Capital Fund under section 9(d) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) $70,000,000,000, which amount shall remain available until expended and, notwithstanding subsections (c)(1) and (d)(2) of such section 9, shall be allocated to public housing agencies based upon the extent of such agencies' capital need,", "completion": " Public Housing Emergency Response Act This bill authorizes additional assistance from the Public Housing Capital Fund to public housing agencies based upon capital need as determined by the agencies' most recent Physical Needs Assessment."}

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Federal Workers Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Federal unions play a critical role in protecting the rights of Federal workers by allowing members to have a collective voice on the job and in the legislative process, advance issues for working families, ensure equal opportunities for all workers, and raise the standards by which all professional and technical workers are employed. (2) Collective bargaining is essential to the union process, because it provides mutual agreement between all parties that fosters harmonious relationships between the Federal Government and its employees and protects the interest of both parties. (3) The current administration has acted through Executive orders and official memorandums to dismantle Federal unions and undermine their collective bargaining rights across the Federal workforce and these directives have already negatively impacted labor contracts, both signed and under active negotiation. (4) These orders set an aggressive schedule for unions to engage in collective bargaining, while also slashing the unions official time for performing union duties by over 91 percent in some cases. These actions are limiting the ability for unions to prepare for negotiations and perform their legally required employee representational duties. (5) Section 7101(a) of title 5, United States Code, states, ``Congress finds that labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest.''. Attempting to eliminate the union by eliminating almost all its official time repudiates the statutory position that unions are in the public interest. (6) Through these orders, agencies are required to comply with artificial bargaining schedules, which undermine good faith negotiations and divert the decision making to an impasse panel, which has no union representation on it and does not represent both parties. (7) Collectively, the administration's actions have violated Congressional intent, undermined the ability of unions to engage in collective bargaining, blocked successful diversity and inclusion training programs, and threatened the rights and benefits of millions of Federal workers.

The Congress finds the following: (1) Hazel Johnson fought for environmental justice in Chicago beginning in the 1970s and continuing through the rest of her life. (2) When Johnson discovered that the South Side of Chicago had the highest cancer rate of any area in Chicago, she was inspired to investigate the cancer rates, foul odors, and number of children with respiratory illnesses in her own neighborhood, the community of Altgeld Gardens on the South Side of Chicago. (3) Johnson discovered her community, Altgeld Gardens, which is a public housing project, was built on a landfill surrounded by toxicity, which polluted the air, water, and land. (4) Additionally, the Altgeld Gardens homes had asbestos and elevated lead levels. (5) This discovery inspired Johnson to create the People for Community Recovery, an organization which fights for a safer environment. (6) Johnson and the People for Community Recovery fought to educate and empower the residents of Altgeld Gardens, including providing workshops and trainings, conducting health surveys, rallying residents to protest contamination, and working with youth in the community. (7) The People for Community Recovery put pressure on the Chicago Housing Authority to remove asbestos from Altgeld Gardens.

(10) Johnson also strove to hold both businesses and the government responsible for how their actions impact the environment. (11) Johnson was given the 1992 President's Environment and Conservation Challenge Award in recognition of her environmental justice work. (12) Notably, Johnson was instrumental in pressuring President Bill Clinton to sign the Environmental Justice Executive Order, which holds the Federal Government accountable for urban communities exposed to pollution. (13) In 2004, sociologist David Naguib Pellow credited Johnson and the People for Community Recovery with putting ``the South Side of Chicago on the radar screen for activists and policy makers around the United States who are concerned about environmental racism''.

This Act may be cited as the ``Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The Constitution gives Congress the sole power to declare war. (2) The framers of the Constitution understood that the monumental decision to go to war, which can result in massive death and the destruction of civilized society, must be made by the representatives of the people and not by a single person. (3) As stated by section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148; 50 U.S.C. 1541), ``the constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces''. (4) Nuclear weapons are uniquely powerful weapons that have the capability to instantly kill millions of people, create long-term health and environmental consequences throughout the world, directly undermine global peace, and put the United States at existential risk from retaliatory nuclear strikes. (5) A first-use nuclear strike carried out by the United States would constitute a major act of war. (6) A first-use nuclear strike conducted absent a declaration of war by Congress would violate the Constitution. (7) The President has the sole authority to authorize the use of nuclear weapons, an order which military officers of the United States must carry out in accordance with their obligations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (8) Given its exclusive power under the Constitution to declare war, Congress must provide meaningful checks and balances to the President's sole authority to authorize the use of a nuclear weapon. (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that no first-use nuclear strike should be conducted absent a declaration of war by Congress. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONDUCT OF FIRST-USE NUCLEAR STRIKES. (a) Prohibition.--No Federal funds may be obligated or expended to conduct a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a war declared by Congress that expressly authorizes such strike. (b) First-Use Nuclear Strike Defined.--In this section, the term ``first-use nuclear strike'' means an attack using nuclear weapons against an enemy that is conducted without the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff first confirming to the President that there has been a nuclear strike against the United", "completion": " Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2021 This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to conduct a first-use nuclear strike unless Congress expressly authorizes such a strike pursuant to a declaration of war.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Climate Action and American Competitiveness Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The United States is a world leader in addressing climate change risks through private sector-led innovation and technological advancement. (2) The United States Energy Information Administration estimates that United States energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, since peaking in 2007, have declined by an average of 1.3 percent per year, starting well before the United States became a party to the Paris Agreement. This decline brought greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest levels since 1992. (3) Nuclear energy accounts for nine of the ten highest- generating power plants in the United States, and produces one- third the carbon dioxide emissions of current solar technologies. (4) According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, the United States has conducted ``the largest absolute decline among all countries since 2000''. (5) President Obama unilaterally joined the Paris Agreement without involving Congress, without consulting outside stakeholders such as energy companies, and without conducting a cost-benefit analysis, including an analysis of how a United States nationally determined contribution (NDC) would impact competitiveness with countries like the People's Republic of China (PRC) that threaten United States national and economic security. (6) A report prepared by NERA Economic Consulting in 2017 found that meeting the commitments President Obama made as part of the Paris Agreement could reduce the United States gross domestic product by $250,000,000,000 and eliminate 2,700,000 jobs by 2025. (7) Despite being the world's second largest economy, the PRC was permitted to be classified as a ``developing country'' for purposes of the Paris Agreement and abused this classification when making its NDC under the Paris Agreement. (8) The PRC is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and according to the NDC submitted by the Chinese Communist Party, it will continue raising emissions until 2030. (9) On September 22, 2020, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced his intention for China to become carbon neutral by 2060, a full decade later than the 2050 target date committed to by other major economies. (10) According to the IEA, coal-fired power plants were the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2018. China has dedicated over $50,000,000,000 through the Belt and Road Initiative to developing coal projects across 150 countries in the past seven years, signaling a lack of genuine intent to combat climate change. (11) During Paris negotiations, then-Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that even if all the developed world, which in this context does not include China, cut carbon dioxide emissions to zero, it would not offset the emissions coming from the rest of the globe. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT. (a) In General.--The President shall notify Congress not fewer than 30 days prior to submitting, pursuant to article 4 of the Paris Agreement, any nationally determined contribution (NDC) on behalf of the United States. (b) Matters To Be Included.--The notification required by subsection (a) shall include the following: (1) A detailed economic justification of the NDC. (2) A cost-benefit analysis of the NDC. (3) An analysis of the NDC's anticipated effect on global carbon dioxide emissions. (4) A description of how the United States will utilize numerous energy sources, including but not limited to nuclear, fossil fuel, and renewable technologies, to achieve the NDC. (5) A description of how the NDC will promote availability of diversified energy supplies and a well-functioning global market for energy resources, technologies, and expertise for the benefit of the United States and United States allies and trading partners. (6) An analysis of the NDCs submitted with respect to the Paris Agreement by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Russian Federation, the anticipated effects on their respective domestic carbon dioxide emissions, and the anticipated effects on their respective global competitiveness. (7) A description of how the NDC will support United States efforts to counter malign Chinese and Russian influence and domination over energy supply chains. (8) A description of how the NDC will support United States international efforts to alleviate energy poverty. (9) A description of how the NDC will impact United States global economic competitiveness. (10) A description of how the NDC will impact United States national security interests.

{"prompt": "Write a concise summary about the following bill:  _______________________________________________________________________ AN ACT To require consultations on reuniting Korean Americans with family members in North Korea. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Divided Families Reunification Act''. SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN AMERICANS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN NORTH KOREA. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The division of the Korean Peninsula into South Korea and North Korea separated thousands of Koreans from family members. (2) Since the signing of the Agreement Concerning a Military Armistice in Korea, signed at Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (commonly referred to as the ``Korean War Armistice Agreement''), there has been little to no contact between Korean Americans and family members who remain in North Korea. (3) North Korea and South Korea first agreed to reunions of divided families in 1985 and have since held 21 face-to-face reunions and multiple video link reunions. (4) Those reunions have subsequently given approximately 24,500 Koreans the opportunity to briefly reunite with loved ones. (5) The most recent family reunions between North Korea and South Korea took place in August 2018 and did not include any Korean Americans. (6) The United States and North Korea do not maintain diplomatic relations and certain limitations exist on Korean Americans participating in face-to-face reunions. (7) According to the most recent census, more than 1,700,000 people living in the United States are of Korean descent. (8) The number of first generation Korean and Korean American family members divided from family members in North Korea is rapidly diminishing given the advanced age of those family members. More than 3,000 elderly South Koreans die each year without having been reunited with their family members. (9) Many Korean Americans with family members in North Korea have not seen or communicated with those family members in more than 60 years. (10) The inclusion of Korean American families in the reunion process, with the support of international organizations with expertise in family tracing, would constitute a positive humanitarian gesture by the Government of North Korea. (11) Section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 407) required the President to submit to Congress a report on ``efforts, if any, of the United States Government to facilitate family reunions between United States citizens and their relatives in North Korea''. (12) The position of Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights Issues has been vacant since January 2017, although the President is required to appoint a Senate-confirmed Special Envoy to fill this position in accordance with section 107 of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7817). (13) In the report of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 3081, 111th Congress (House Report 111-187), the Committee urged ``the Special Representative on North Korea Policy, as the senior official handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the issues involving Korean divided families and to, if necessary, appoint a coordinator for such families''. (14) In the report of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 133, 116th Congress (House Report 116-444), the Committee urged ``the Office of North Korean Human Rights, in consultation with Korean American community organizations, to identify Korean Americans who wish to be reunited with their family in North Korea in anticipation of future reunions''. (b) Consultations.-- (1) Consultations with south korea.--The Secretary of State, or a designee of the Secretary, should consult with officials of South Korea, as appropriate, on potential opportunities to reunite Korean American families with family members in North Korea from which such Korean American families were divided after the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, including potential opportunities for video reunions for Korean Americans with such family members. (2) Consultations with korean americans.--The Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights Issues of the Department of State should regularly consult with representatives of Korean Americans who have family members in North Korea with respect to efforts to reunite families divided after the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, including potential opportunities for video reunions for Korean Americans with such family members. (3) No additional authorization of appropriations.--No additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State to carry out consultations under this subsection. (c) Additional Matter in Report.--The Secretary of State, acting through the Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights Issues, shall include in each report required under section 107(d) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7817(d)), a description of the consultations described in subsection (b) conducted during the year preceding the submission of each report required under such section 107(d).

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel PTSD Collaborative Research Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a given year. In addition, that figure amounts to about 12 percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 30 percent of Vietnam veterans. (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that among women veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. (3) In the United States, it is thought that 70 percent of Americans have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and approximately 20 percent of those persons have struggled or continue to struggle with symptoms of PTSD. (4) Studies show that PTSD has links to homelessness and substance abuse in the United States. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that approximately 11 percent of the homeless population are veterans and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that about 7 percent of veterans have a substance abuse disorder. (5) Our ally Israel, under constant attack from terrorist groups, experiences similar issues with Israeli veterans facing PTSD symptoms. Tel Aviv University's National Center for Traumatic Stress and Resilience found that 5 to 8 percent of combat soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and during wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 percent. (6) Current treatment options in the United States focus on cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, but the United States must continue to look for more effective treatments. Several leading Israeli hospitals, academic institutions, and nonprofits dedicate research and services to treating PTSD. SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM FOR INCREASED COOPERATION ON POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER RESEARCH BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Program, should seek to explore scientific collaboration between American academic institutions and nonprofit research entities, and Israeli institutions with expertise in researching, diagnosing, and treating post-traumatic stress disorder. (b) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of State, shall award grants to eligible entities to carry out collaborative research between the United States and Israel with respect to post-traumatic stress disorders.

Students need guidance and skills to help them navigate these complex decisions, which have serious and life changing consequences. ``(7) School counseling programs are essential for students to achieve optimal personal growth, acquire positive social skills and values, set appropriate career goals, and realize full academic potential to become productive, contributing members of the world community. ``(8) Professional secondary school counselors are highly qualified educators with a mental health perspective who understand and respond to the challenges presented by today's diverse student population. ``(9) The professional secondary school counselor holds a master's degree or higher in school counseling (or the substantial equivalent), and is certified or licensed by the State in which the counselor works. ``(10) Professional secondary school counselors are integral to the total educational program. They provide proactive leadership that engages all stakeholders in the delivery of programs and services to help the student achieve success in school. Professional secondary school counselors align and work with the school's mission to support the academic achievement of all students as they prepare for the ever-changing world of the 21st century. ``(11) Professional secondary school counselors' opportunities to assist students are often hindered by extraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. Currently, the average student-to-counselor ratio in America's public schools is 430 to 1. The American School Counselor Association, the American Counseling Association, and the National Association for College Admissions Counseling all recommend a ratio of one school counselor to 250 students and a lower ratio for counselors working primarily with students at risk. ``SEC. 1442. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. ``(a) In General.--From amounts made available to carry out this subpart, the Secretary shall carry out a demonstration project under which the Secretary makes grants on a competitive basis to secondary schools that receive funds under this title and have a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate of 60 percent or lower. ``(b) Grants.--A grant under this subpart shall be for a period of 4 years and may be used-- ``(1) to provide additional school counselors during that period; and ``(2) to provide additional resources (such as professional development expenses or travel expenses for home visits, and any services and materials referred to in subsection (d)) and to pay overhead expenses. ``(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a participating school should aim to provide, under subsection (b)(1), one additional counselor per 250 students at risk. ``(d) Scope of Counseling.--The additional school counselors shall identify students who are at risk of not graduating in 4 years and shall provide counseling primarily to those students. The counselors may identify such students at any time, but shall strive to identify them before they enter grade 9. Services shall be provided as long as necessary, including to the extent allowable and appropriate, after the student's cohort graduation date. The counseling provided-- ``(1) may include a full panoply of services, including an individual graduation plan and other resources, such as appropriate course placement and supplemental services (to include not only supplemental educational services tutoring if available at the school site, but also other tutoring as necessary, along with supplemental books and materials); and ``(2) shall include meetings with each student so identified and with the teachers, tutors, supplemental educational services providers, and parents of the student, and may also include meetings with other relevant individuals, such as a probation officer, mentor, coach, or employer of the student. ``(e) Supplement Not Supplant.--Funds under this subpart shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds from non-Federal sources. The additional school counselors provided through funds under this subpart must be in addition to any employees who work in the secondary school guidance or counseling office, such as counselors, college admissions specialists, career development specialists, guidance information specialists, or any other professional or paraprofessional. ``(f) Additional Grant Periods.-- ``(1) In general.--A school that receives a grant under this subpart and demonstrates adequate improvement over the period of the grant is eligible to receive a second grant for a second period. If the school again demonstrates adequate improvement over that second period, the school is eligible to receive a third grant for a third period. The third grant shall provide amounts that decrease for each year of the third period and require the school to provide corresponding increases in non-Federal funds. ``(2) Adequate improvement.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a school demonstrates adequate improvement over a grant period if the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate increases (or is projected to increase) by 10 percent or more over that period. ``(g) Selection.--The Secretary shall carry out the demonstration project in at least 10 schools. The first five schools selected to participate shall each be from a different State. ``SEC. 1443. DEFINITION. ``(a) In General.--For purposes of this subpart. the term `regular high school diploma' means the standard high school diploma awarded to the preponderance of students in the State that is fully aligned with State standards, or a higher diploma, and does not include GEDs, certificates of attendance, or any lesser diploma award. ``(b) Special Rule.--For those students who have significant cognitive disabilities and are assessed using an alternate assessment aligned to alternate achievement standards, receipt of a regular high school diploma or State-defined alternate diploma aligned with completion of their entitlement under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall be counted as graduates with a regular high school diploma for the purposes of this Act. No more than 1 percent of students can be counted as graduates with a regular high school diploma under this subparagraph. ``SEC. 1444. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subpart $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024.''. SEC. 3.

The additional school counselors must primarily serve students identified as being at risk of not graduating in four years. Grantees that demonstrate progress in improving their graduation rates&nbsp;shall be&nbsp;eligible for subsequent grants. "}

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Civics Learning Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The dearth of civics lessons available to students across the United States has helped to foster a political climate that is deeply partisan and divided. (2) Polarized party politics in the United States has fractured public morale in our institutions and has created an environment in which people are less likely to be well-informed on the current state of affairs and to participate in the political process. (3) According to the Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania-- (A) in 2018, only 32 percent of people in the United States surveyed were capable of naming all 3 branches of Government, while 33 percent of Americans were not able to name any of the branches of government; (B) in 2018, 30 percent of people in the United States surveyed knew that the Senate is in charge of Supreme Court nominee confirmations; and (C) in 2017, 37 percent could not name any of the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. (4) In 2014, only 23 percent of eighth graders were found to have performed at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress civics exam conducted by the National Center of Education Studies. (5) A lack of knowledge on the basics of the structure of our democratic republic creates an increasingly ill-prepared electorate which over time has, and will continue to, contribute to a weakened democracy.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Dr. Li Wenliang Congressional Gold Medal Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Dr. Li Wenliang was a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, China, who died from the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID- 19) after he sought to draw attention to the spread of the virus despite the Chinese government's effort to suppress him. (2) Research indicates that the first patient infected with COVID-19 exhibited symptoms in early December 2019, if not earlier. (3) In December 2019, Dr. Li Wenliang notified his colleagues in the medical community in China about the outbreak of COVID-19. (4) On January 3, 2020, after raising concerns about the spread of COVID-19, Dr. Li Wenliang and seven other doctors were detained and questioned by Chinese officials. Dr. Li Wenliang was forced to sign a statement retracting his warnings about the virus and confessing that he had spread illegal rumors. (5) Chinese government authorities played down dangers to the public for weeks as COVID-19 continued to spread, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China alone and at least 1,000 deaths reported as of February 11, 2020. (6) Dr. Li Wenliang continued to work at Wuhan Central Hospital despite his knowledge of the outbreak, and appears to have been infected himself with COVID-19 after coming in contact with a patient he was treating. (7) In February 2020, in the hospital where he worked, Dr. Li Wenliang died after contracting COVID-19. (8) Before his death, Dr. Li Wenliang stated, ``If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.''. (9) The people of China expressed their grief and anger on social media after the death of Dr. Li Wenliang with the phrase ``I want freedom of speech'', which was quickly censored by the Government of the People's Republic of China. (10) The Chinese government inflicted incalculable damage on their own people and the rest of the world by trying to extinguish the news of the COVID-19 rather than mobilize global efforts to battle it. (11) Awarding Dr. Li Wenliang the Congressional Gold Medal, would not only recognize his bold actions to draw attention to the spread of COVID-19, but call global attention to China's lack of transparency and censorship of speech.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Restoration of the U.S.-Russia Polar Bear Conservation Fund Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the polar bear population is currently at 20,000 to 25,000 bears, up from as low as 5,000 to 10,000 bears in the 1950s and 1960s. (2) A 2002 United States Geological Survey of wildlife in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain noted that the polar bear populations ``may now be near historic highs''. (3) A permit fee for importing polar bears will invigorate the public-private funding partnership for the United States- Russian Polar Bear Conservation Fund. (4) TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, has stated both that ``the global population of Polar Bears is not small and the species' area of distribution is not restricted,'' and ``[t]rade does not appear to be a significant threat to the species.''. TRAFFIC also recommended that the polar bear not be uplisted to appendix 1 at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). (5) The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)/Species Survival Commission (SSC) Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), has stated that further trade restrictions on the polar bear are ``unlikely to confer a conservation benefit, and could have a negative impact on socioeconomic systems as well as domestic and international partnerships''. (6) The International Union for Conservation of Nature has found that ``hunting is a form of wildlife use that, when well- managed, may assist in furthering conservation objectives by creating the revenue and economic incentives for the management and conservation of the target species and its habitat, as well as supporting local livelihoods''.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business PPE Tax Credit Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) On January 21, 2020, the United States confirmed the Nation's first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus, which presents as the disease COVID-19. (2) On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization upgraded the COVID-19 outbreak from global health emergency status to a pandemic. (3) On March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a restriction on gatherings of 50 or more people in the United States. (4) Beginning in mid-March, the administration issued new guidelines on the pandemic and called for nationwide social distancing, among other precautions, to slow the spread of COVID-19. (5) On March 17, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, in his capacity as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained that ``social distancing is really physical separation of people, wherein circumstances where there are crowds, you remove yourself from very close contact.'' (6) Most Governors executed orders in States across the country to close or restrict operations of business across various industries on a temporary basis, in an effort to promote social distancing, stymie the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and flatten the curve so as not to overwhelm the Nation's health care system's capacity. (7) Those closures or operating limitations have caused significant strain on America's small businesses in the interest of public health. (8) Small businesses are the engine of the United States economy, comprising 99 percent of all business ventures in the United States and accounting for half of the United States economy. (9) In order to safely resume full operations, these small businesses need access to personal protective equipment; in some cases, States are requiring employers and employees use this personal protective equipment in order to allow public entry. (10) Due to the fiscal strain of pandemic-related losses on these small businesses, they cannot and should not bear the financial burden of acquiring personal protective equipment without relief. (11) Providing relief through a tax credit for the purchase and use of personal protective equipment will directly support small businesses returning to and exceeding pre-COVID-19 pandemic production levels. (12) At a Small Business Committee forum on May 28, 2020, Mr. Charles ``Tee'' Rowe, President and Chief Executive Officer of America's SBDC, testified to the potential value of such credits. (13) Personal protective equipment tax credits will be instrumental in safely and responsibly restarting the engine of the United States economy. SEC. 3. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TAX CREDIT.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ```Six Triple Eight' Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law legislation that established the Women's Army Corps (referred to in this section as the ``WAC'') as a component in the Army. The WAC was converted from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (referred to in this section as the ``WAAC''), which had been created in 1942 without official military status. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder of the National Council of Negro Women, advocated for the admittance of African-American women into the newly formed WAC to serve as officers and enlisted personnel. (2) Dubbed ``10 percenters'', the recruitment of African- American women to the WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the population of the WAAC to match the proportion of African Americans in the national population. Despite an Executive order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 banning racial discrimination in civilian defense industries, the Armed Forces remained segregated. Enlisted women served in segregated units, participated in segregated training, lived in separate quarters, ate at separate tables in mess halls, and used segregated recreational facilities. Officers received their officer candidate training in integrated units but lived under segregated conditions. Specialist and technical training schools were integrated in 1943. During World War II, a total of 6,520 African-American women served in the WAAC and the WAC. (3) After several units of White women were sent to serve in the European Theater of Operations (referred to in this section as the ``ETO'') during World War II, African-American organizations advocated for the War Department to extend the opportunity to serve overseas to African-American WAC units. (4) In November 1944, the War Department approved sending African-American women to serve in Europe. A battalion of all African-American women drawn from the WAC, the Army Service Forces, and the Army Air Forces was created and designated as the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion (referred to in this section as the ``6888th''), which was nicknamed the ``Six Triple Eight''. (5) Army officials reported a shortage of qualified postal officers within the ETO, which resulted in a backlog of undelivered mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, the ever-changing locations of servicemembers hampered the delivery of mail to those servicemembers. Because 7,000,000 civilians and military personnel from the United States served in the ETO, many of those individuals had identical names. For example, 7,500 such individuals were named Robert Smith. One general predicted that the backlog in Birmingham, England, would take 6 months to process and the lack of reliable mail service was hurting morale. (6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in Birmingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th found warehouses filled with millions of pieces of mail intended for members of the Armed Forces, United States Government personnel, and Red Cross workers serving in the ETO. (7) The 6888th created effective processes and filing systems to track individual servicemembers, organize ``undeliverable'' mail, determine the intended recipient for insufficiently addressed mail, and handle mail addressed to servicemembers who had died. Adhering to their motto of ``No mail, low morale'', the women processed an average of 65,000 pieces of mail per shift and cleared the 6-month backlog of mail within 3 months.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Children with Disabilities During COVID-19 Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) A free appropriate public education is a fundamental educational right of all children with disabilities, guaranteed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). (2) More than 7,000,000 school-aged children with disabilities, approximately 13 percent of the total student enrollment, are currently entitled to individualized education and related services mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. (3) Nearly 500,000 infants and toddlers, as well as their families, receive supports and services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and these early interventions have been proven to improve education outcomes. (4) Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, schools and lead agencies responsible for the administration of funds under part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as ``lead agencies'') are required to provide early intervention, special education, and related services to children with disabilities, an obligation that requires services outlined in a child's individualized family service plan (referred to as an ``IFSP'') or individualized education program (referred to as an ``IEP''). (5) Children with disabilities have been disproportionately impacted by the disruptions to education resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, with many children with disabilities needing additional supports and services to meet their IEP and IFSP goals as the delivery of education and services has shifted from in-person to remote formats. (6) Local educational agencies and lead agencies face extra costs associated with adjusting services and continuing to provide a free, appropriate public education while children with disabilities are receiving services through distance learning and remote service delivery. (7) Schools are facing unprecedented budget challenges due to the rising costs of responding to COVID-19, coupled with State and local revenue shortfalls, as well as the severe and persistent underfunding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. (8) To ensure that schools and lead agencies continue to meet the needs of children with disabilities and their families, including providing trained and certified special educators and education support specialists, emergency supplemental funding is needed under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. (9) Emergency supplemental funding is also needed under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) because services provided under that Act help ensure that students with disabilities have the technology devices and services they need to access equal educational opportunities. SEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``American Values and Security in International Athletics Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) In 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) revised its Host City Contract to require host countries to ``protect and respect human rights and ensure any violation of human rights is remedied in a manner consistent with international agreements, laws, and regulations applicable in the Host Country and in a manner consistent with all internationally recognised human rights standards and principles, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, applicable in the Host Country''. (2) The Olympic Charter states the goal of Olympism is ``to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity''. (3) The IOC set up an advisory committee on human rights in December 2018, and IOC President Thomas Bach said, ``Promoting humanistic values in sport has been a core feature of the IOC since its beginning. Our mission, to put sport at the service of humanity, goes hand-in-hand with human rights, which is part of our DNA.''. (4) In the report, ``The Cybersecurity of Olympic Sports: New Opportunities, New Risks'', the UC Berkley Center for Long- Term Cybersecurity listed the ``hacking and release of sensitive athletic data'' as one of the four significant categories of cyberattacks on major sporting events. (5) According to the State Department's 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the People's Republic of China's Ministry of Public Security employs ``tens of millions of surveillance cameras'' to monitor the general public, as well as ``political dissidents, religious leaders and adherents, Tibetans, and Uyghurs''. (6) The People's Republic of China (PRC) Government's extensive use of artificial intelligence surveillance technology, including facial and voice pattern recognition technology, poses grave humanitarian, privacy, and security concerns. PRC authorities have used surveillance technology to monitor, control, and repress an estimated 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. PRC State media has confirmed that ``voice, image, position and behavior recognition technologies'' will be used in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. SEC. 3.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Home Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that: (1) Adopted children may be most at risk of experiencing an unregulated custody transfer because the challenges associated with adoptions, including the child's mental health needs and the difficulties many families face in acquiring support services, may lead families to seek out unregulated custody transfers. (2) Many adopted children experience trauma, and the disruption and placement in another home by unregulated custody transfer creates additional trauma and instability for the child. (3) Children who experience an unregulated custody transfer may be placed with families who have not completed required child welfare or criminal background checks or clearances. (4) Social services agencies and courts are often unaware of the placement of children through unregulated custody transfer and therefore do not conduct assessments on the child's safety and well-being in such placements. (5) Such lack of placement oversight places a child at risk for future abuse and increases the likelihood that the child may experience-- (A) physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect; (B) contact with unsafe adults or youth; and (C) exposure to unsafe or isolated environments. (6) The caregivers with whom a child is placed through unregulated custody transfer often have no legal responsibility with respect to such child, placing the child at risk for additional unregulated custody transfers. (7) Such caregivers also may not have complete records, including birth, medical, or immigration records. (8) A child adopted through intercountry adoption may be at risk of not acquiring United States citizenship if an unregulated custody transfer occurs before the adoptive parents complete all necessary steps to finalize the adoption of such child.
